            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It was firſt his will to warne the vnſtaied by his fall, and to inſtruct the inconſtaunt, to gather vp the fruites of experience, ſo as the after repentaunce might not make them loathſome. He was counſailed by the aduiſe of aged <hi>Aristo,</hi> yet refuſed it. He was admoniſhed by the fall of <hi>Porcia,</hi> yet he continued vnconſtaunt. What women were, <hi>Lamia</hi> taught hym. What Loue was, <hi>Titerus</hi> made triall: and neither the perſwaſion of a gallant Soldiour, nor the aduiſe of an auncient Father, neither
<pb facs="tcp:16402:4"/> yet the ſharpe inuectiues of his trauailyng companion <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio,</hi> were euer able to withhold hym, but he would needes proſecute his follie to the ende.</p>
            <p>Theſe medicines opertunitie offered hym in his firſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, now what ſucceedeth in this volume, let the aduiſed Reader be Iudge.

               <p>Then <hi>Justinians radices</hi> were not knowne, but the lawe of the Tables were taught, then the lawe was not in the Ciuill Magiſtrate to diſpoſe, but the Prieſt had it to propounde, that lawe was deliuered by ſucceſſion, and confirmed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lawgiuer, and while that lawe was continued, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi> was partaker of the promiſe, and benefited by the plentie, the Heathen fell before them, for the Lorde of hoſtes was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

               <p>Now <hi>Signior Sandalio,</hi> you may ſée that I am led by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not fed by opinion, I take not hold faſt of any report: but am confirmed by myne owne knowledge, for reſortyng to our common place of Iuſtice, I heare many execrations powred out: ſome openly exclaime againſt iniurious delaies, fewe or none liue by gettyng, al ſpend, ſo that Lawyers are only made riche, the poore Client miſerablie poore.</p>
               <p>But you maie well ſaie that this toucheth nothyng the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it ſelf, and admit I thinke ſo, notwithſtandyng this I muſte and maie conclude touching the controuerſie that wee haue now in hand, that where as the ground works of law, are at the diſpoſition and inuention of man, thei are by farre oddes more baſe then our preceptes which are written and ſet downe with the finger of God, deliuered by thoſe that were enſpired by God, yea, and ſo thei take efecte, as not onely thei are the ground worke of all other profeſſions, but alſo the mainteiners of all both Deuine and Ciuill policies.</p>
               <p>But you may (perhappes) thinke to touche me nere, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng what I ſpeake of Deuinitie it ſelf, but reprehendyng the profeſſors of the ſame, yet herein if you bethinke your ſelfe, of the ſureſt holdfaſt, you ſhall bee the fartheſt of from your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Then the religious who more deuoute? as <hi>Apolonius</hi> the Abbot, who an hundred tymes daie and night with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and compunction of ſpirite called vpon the higheſt, in his often prayer who wondreth not at his diligence, in his ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of his knees, who praiſeth not his humilitie. <hi>Pastuuius</hi> an other of our profeſſion, was ſo intentiuely bent to prayer (as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> reporteth) that in health he was neuer found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied, in ſickneſſe when weakeneſſe conſtrained hym to keepe his bed ſat ſtill deuoute, hauyng the vſe of his tongue taken from hym, yet continued religious, yea, no ſoner ceaſed he meditation then his ſoule was ſeparated from his bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſace Sirus</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Spoletum,</hi> praied continually three daies and three nightes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knees without ceaſyng, which ſome of the Citie admittyng for an hypocriticall attempt ſtroke hym, reuilyng him with vngracious and bad language: whiche notwithſtandyng, ſuche was the zeale that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb facs="tcp:16402:7"/> him, and the Iudgement of God that awaited on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that the vnhappie mocker and ſtriker of this holy man, was poſſeſſed with a Deuill, wherein this vertuous Votiue not reſpectyng the iniurie offered, but the zeale of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, by prayer ſuccoured and reſtored for an iniurious wrong a gracious benefite.</p>
               <p>Many other could I repeate vnto you: who not onely for their aſſidious prayer, but alſo for their integritie of life, the worlde hath had and doeth holde, in wonderfull admiration. But <hi>Signior Pierro de feragoſa,</hi> thinke you in theſe actions to ſcape ſcotfree, aſſuredly ſir that maie not bee, for well I wote you are as ſtudiouſly bent to take holde of the poore Deuine, as any, yea, and as erreligious as the beſt: for your profeſſion the more I looke into it, the more I looth it, preferryng with <hi>Tully</hi> the iniuſtiſt Peace before the iuſtiſt Warre: accompting Soldiours the moſt vnneceſſarie members that maie bee in a State: For that by experience, their practiſe, their honour, nay all actions whatſoeuer thei attempt, are begun, continued, and ended in bloud.</p>
               <p>Theſe Soldiours the beſt ſorte of them, what be thei, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes noble in birthe, yet laſciuious in behauiour, conſtaunt in nothyng but in crueltie, wiſe in fewe thynges but in Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes, in reuengyng to cruell, in vnchaſt loue to diſſolute, the Captaine in feare of the Soldiour, the Soldiour cozoned by the Captaine, and bothe of them commonly the conſumers of the Citizens. Let Warre once take holde of a plentious lande, the Citizen is made ſubiect in his owne houſe, his wife deflowred, his daughters defamed, his riches not his owne, yet all this while the Soldiour will bee coumpted commodious: And were thei to bee admitted in a State, the Countrey Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman is forced by feare to forſake his labour, and what he trauaileth for in ſorowe, the Soldiour conſumeth in riot. But neither the beginning of Warre, neither the effect, neither the action, nor the agent are vertuous, and therefore not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. The beginnyng of Diſſention was deſire and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of others Poſſeſſions. The effect of Warre, is the deſtruction of Countries, the deſolation of noble Houſes, and
<pb facs="tcp:16402:8"/> the ſackyng of opulent Cities: the action dependeth vpon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or miſfortune: vppon oportunities, delaies, forwardneſſe and vntowardneſſe of a number of vaine headed followers, whoſe behauiour and life, beeyng neuer leueled nor ordered by derection, how maie it bee thought that any of their actions ſhould be either praiſe worthie or vertuous. They are the hyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges of ambicious Princes, whom though the ſubiect alow of for feare, yet would thei gainſaie them if thei durſt.</p>
               <p>Naturally the Soldiour is borne Martialiſt, bloudy myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſubiect to rage and anger vpon ſleight or no cauſe, whiche hath followyng her alwaies reuenge: Now, if the Soldiour growe into furie on ſo light occaſion, thinke you the reuenge to be ordered by diſcretion. What Prince can eſcape the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours furie? nay, are not thei naturally mutinous in themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues? How iniuriouſly left the <hi>Egiptians</hi> their Kyng <hi>Pſamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricus</hi> in his Warre againſt the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> when as two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande of them at one inſtaunt reuolted to the Enemie, neither hauyng reſpect to the honour of their Prince, nor the ſauegard of their Countrey.</p>
               <p>Nay when the <hi>Romaine</hi> Horſemen were ſent out to incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter the power of their enemies, when at pleaſure thei might haue deſtroyed them, yet remembryng the delaie, their conſull <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> made in paſſing the law <hi>Agraria,</hi> thei pretermited to their great ſhame, the offered opertunitie.</p>
               <p>The like miſcheefes by their meanes fell on <hi>Apius Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> who for that thei would diſpoſſeſſe him of his Triumph, they admitted rather of a diſhonourable flight.</p>
               <p>I would note alſo the defect of the Frenchmen, vnder the gouernment of <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> the horrible murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on <hi>Anthony Baſſianus Carracalla</hi> Emproure by his ſworne Soldiour <hi>Martialis,</hi> and the deſtruction of <hi>Adoaldus</hi> Kyng of <hi>Gothes,</hi> by one of his owne retinew called <hi>Zilla Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pida.</hi> Truly truly, the memorie of the notable diſaſters, vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and bloudie Murthers, Inceſtious and vngodly Rapes committed by the Soldiours, inforceth me almoſt into a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to call them to remembraunce.</p>
               <p>But let vs but haue an eye towardes themſelues, &amp; beholde
<pb facs="tcp:16402:8"/> how beaſtly thei bee, the bruite beaſt by naturall inſtinct doe daily eſchewe the inconuenience that folowe them: and haue an eye to that whiche may profite them.

               <p>It erketh me to remember the horible and murtherous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefes that befortuned vnhappie <hi>Roome</hi> in the tyme of the ſedicious Warriour <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> how many notable Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, renowned Orators, aged Fathers, ſuckyng Children, and ſorrowfull Mothers were deuoured by this Monſter, who was not onely ſatiſfied to martire them by his Tormentors, but alſo endeuoured to be an actor in miniſtryng the torment, wher neither eloquence, neither deſert towardes the common weale, neither the teares of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Matrons, nor the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Cities in league could ſtaie the furie of ſo greate a bloudſucker, but that <hi>Marcus Anthoni</hi> that ſweete tongued Orrator (who in tyme by his eloquent perſwaſion aſſwaged the furie of the Soldiour, and kept his ſworde in ſheath) muſt ſacrifice with his bloude to the vniuſt fury of <hi>Marius:</hi> the father and the ſonne both <hi>Craſſi,</hi> in eche others ſight were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly murthered.

Saincte <hi>Fraunces</hi> trauilyng in companie with one of his fraternitie, and thei meetyng with a poore man, the Frier his companion ſaied vnto him: Father, although this man be poore touchyng the riches of the worlde, it maie be yet, in deſire to enioy much,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:9"/> he is riche: which ſpeeches beyng well waied of this Godly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he forced this coniecturyng Deuine to diſrobe him ſelf and to couer the poore man, thinkyng hym worthie to make recompence by a benefite, who with leude language had iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſlie ſlaundered the poore man.</p>

               <p>In my readyng this finde I Sir <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> yea, and further more dare aſſure you, that what ſo you cry out on in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, we condemne in place of Iuſtice, and what ſo you finde neglected in religion, we correcte with greate ſeuereneſſe.</p>
               <p>I ſee not moreouer how you are to touch the perſon of the Lawyer, more then your ſelf, either with contrarious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or vnneceſſarie poſitions, or iniurious delaies, or auari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſires. In general, the men be very ſtudious (for the art requires no leſſe) and where the mind is ocupied with wiſe preceptes, the actions of the life can hardly be vnconſtant, if at any tyme contrarieties paſſe, vnleſſe in a particuler mans opinion, this toucheth not the Lawe it ſelf with any varietie, but the miſdeamyng man: yea, you knowe well in arte, this matter is vndoubtedly true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by contraries the truth is ſoneſt founde out, and without controuertyng (in myne opinion) the groundworkes of all artes ſhould bee lefte but nakedly bare, but for the ſcience in it ſelf, it is ſtill the ſame neuer alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng. What the Cannon Lawe is and of what authoritie, you can as well as I beare witneſſe, whiche hath his original from the mouthe of our holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> and from the counſailes, from the decrees of the auncient Fathers, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb facs="tcp:16402:10"/> of learned Deuines, the whiche (I beleeue) you admit nothyng more holy, ſince by the Church, the diſanullers of the ſame are excommunicated with <hi>Bell Booke and Candle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for all this if it might be ſpoken, <hi>non idem ſemper eſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> I muſt not ſaie contrarious, but if libertie were graunted me to touche what I knowe true, Lorde what ſquaryng could I finde amongſt your generall Counſailes, what daliaunce with Scriptures: ſhould I ſaie wreſtyng of them, no, mum budget, you are of the holy houſe, and therefore farre be it from me to reproue you, when I like not the looke of a faggot: But this I dare ſaie for the Deuine, as he for the Lawyer hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie auowed, he hath as humble a Habite as the beſt, yet as laſciuious is he as the moſte, whiche poinct although you can hardly faſten vppon the Lawyer, yet the moſt parte of you, can not but in your conſcience confeſſe you culpable: yea, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Deuine is couetous too, and can as well ſkill of a <hi>Peter peney,</hi> as the Lawyer of his Clientes fee. But it maie bee that what ſo is viſcious in the Lawyer, ſhall be vertuous in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and ſo in deede you maie matche me: Yet for examples ſake I will open the liues of ſome of our <hi>Romiſhe</hi> Prelattes, whom though you haue preferred worthely for their humilitie, yet ſome I maie touche for their approued follies: ſo that with you I will turne all vppon the Cleargy men, and leaue the Scripture, as it is perfect in it ſelf, except it be peruerted by his Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Amongſt you Prelattes ſome are <hi>Heritickes,</hi> ſome to much learnyng doeth make them mad: Some blinde buſſardes that will not ſee: Some ſo well learned that thei liſt to erre. So that you ſhall confeſſe (except of purpoſe you will proue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) that more Cleargie men haue erred touchyng the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scriptures, then Ciuilians euer doated in the Cannons of the Lawe.</p>

If you will be more worthie, then in offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, you are the more to be miſliked of. If you wil be heades, why gouerne you not diſcreetly. If you will haue ſuperioritie, why are you ſo negligent: Humilitie deſpiſeth honour, yet you hunt after them: Thoſe that ſauer of the worlde are not of God, yet are you worldly: The high mynded often erre, yet can not the Cleargie man varie: for what ſo is perpetrated or attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any of you, though it paſſe the limites of vertue, it can not be but vice: though it be irreligious, it can not be without religion: though it bee blacke it muſt bee white, and why, you that make all colours, will diſpoſe of them as you liſt. Your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes bee penetrated to looke on all men, yet all men muſt bee blinde leaſt thei looke into you: ſo that I muſt euen conclude of you thus, you are of that making, that onely you are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Iudgement of the worlde by your owne power, and the world muſt of force alowe of you for Correctors, where as in ſooth your ſelues are moſt worthie to bee corrected. Yet in truthe (Sir <hi>Sebastian</hi>) I miſdeeme not of your opinion in the Soldiour: for in that I doe agree ſo well with you, as I vtterly forbid hym a place in a well gouerned State: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I alowe your learned poſitions, examples and concluſions. For what is there to be allowed of in Warlike bloudſuckers: not their pollicie, for that it hath relation to an ill end: not their dilligence, for that it reſpecteth nought but murther: not their obedience, for that it is for feare: not their Iudgementes, for that thei are ſeuere: not their orders, becauſe thei are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to commaunde: not their life, becauſe it is leude.</p>
               <p>Their imagination is reuenge, their mindes bloudie, their diſpoſitions wrathfull, their attempt vnconſtaunt: yea, and ſuche thei be as will ſell God for golde, and their Countrie for commoditie.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Father <hi>Sebastian</hi> hath touched this clauſe nere enough, I will be the breefer onely addyng this anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Don Pierros</hi> apologie, that the Soldiour is not ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:16402:12"/> acounted of amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt Princes as the Lawyer, for that which in our memorie a moſt renounced Emperour <hi>Sigiſmunde,</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite valewe, yea, and a braue Soldiour confirmed it to one <hi>George Ficellas</hi> a learned Lawyer, on whom he not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the order of Knyghthoode, but in all cauſes he alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him as a Counſailer, whiche beyng obicted againſt him by ſome of his noble Soldiours, he made anſwere, that it was eaſie for him to make an hundred Soldiours in one daie, but to make a Doctor, required a thouſand yeres.</p>
               <p>Herein maie our Soldiour perceiue (if he pleaſe) how light their profeſſion is when it is learned in a daie, and how farre to be vnworthie in reſpect of the Lawyer, when a Prince of ſuch memorie concluded of it ſo ſlenderly.</p>
               <p>I could report vnto you father, the eſtimation that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had of the Ciuilian <hi>Vlpianus,</hi> whom in all his ſecrete at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes and ſerious buſineſſes, he tooke counſaile of him, and would admit nothing to paſſe, whiche were not confirmed by him.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Princes of our tyme haue ſo honoured Lawyers, as that thei by ſpeciall authoritie inioyned them, that if ought did paſſe their handes (yea, though vnder priuie ſignet) thei ſhould not alowe, were it repugnant or contrarie to Law.</p>
               <p>My concluſion is therfore noble Iudge, that ſince the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is leſſe vicious then the Deuine, and of greater dignitie then is the Soldiour, he ſhould haue place aboue them bothe, whereas the one is exceſſiuely ſinfull, the other excedingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and cruell. The determination whereof I leaue to your correction, and now yeeld ſucceſſiuely the roome to <hi>Don Piero de Feragoſa</hi> to ſpeake for him ſelf.</p>
               <p>Our Soldiour hauyng attentiuely bent his eare to either of the inuectiues, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded with him ſelf how to aunſwer, began to diſcourſe thus.</p>

               <p>In my youth when I was bookiſhe, I remember I red a Pretie Storie of Sainct <hi>Barnade,</hi> who if by chaunce he fortuned to ſpy out a poore man meanly appareled, he would alwaies ſaie to hym ſelf thus: truely <hi>Barnade</hi> this man with more pacience beareth his croſſe then thou.

               <p>
                  <hi>Aeſopes</hi> Crowe and our Cleargie men are now adaies of one condition, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bird cared not how many fethers ſhe borowed to make her ſelf braue, nor thei how many vices thei correct, ſo thei cloake their owne, the birde in aſpiryng to be Kyng had a reprochfull fall, and diſrobed of her plumes proued but a blacke Crowe, the Cleargie men, in endeuoryng to ſeeme ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue vicious, and but ſeuered from the dignitie of their profeſſion, are in the ende as blacke in vices as the birde in colours.</p>
               <p>Thinke you (good Sir <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>) that as nature hath made vs Soldiours reſonable, ſo ſhe hathe not alowed vs the fruites of reaſon, both to looke into other mens actions and to order our owne, yes ſir yes, though the clarke be neuer ſo ſubtil the Soldiour can compaſſe him, and the Lawyer neuer ſo craftie ſimplicitie may diſcouer him: and in that you make Soldiours altogither vicious, it muſt nedes fall out that ſome of your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:16402:13"/> &amp; theirs are of acquaintau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or els yours are ſo proud that thei diſdaine ours. But becauſe you muſt not erre, you are with out ſinne, yet notwithſtandyng, giue me leaue to ſaie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in mine owne cauſe. The Soldiour ſaie (Maiſter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine) is an vnneceſſarie member, the onely maintainer of the aſpiryng Princes pleaſure, the foe of Citezens, the diſtroier of countrie men, the ſacker of Cities, the deflourer of Maidens, a light headed reuenger, a harebrained atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pter, a bloudie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, conſtant in nothing but in crueltie, yea, to conclude worthie of nothyng but not to bee.</p>
               <p>Now I by my experience can ſhew, and by your profeſſion will perſwade either of you, that a Soldiour in liuing is more continent then you both, and for a Commonwealth as profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the beſt. Warre is a miniſter of Gods Iuſtice, for either contempt of Religion, or wicked life in ciuill Mageſtrates, ſo that it is your ſinnes that drawethe the Soldiours ſworde: whiche if you liued well ſhould be ſheathed perpetually. God is not the author of ill, but the chafticer of abuſe, he ordereth the will of Princes to reuenge, and we as obedient ſubiectes, are the miniſters to performe. If power were not to maintaine Princes Proceedinges, the Prince ſhould be diſpoſſeſt of his ſtate, cruell handes would be laide on the Miniſtrie, yea, the Lawyer pulde from place of Iuſtice: ſo that in peace, the name of a Soldiour reſtraineth the rebillious, in warre makes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the proudeſt reſiſter.</p>
               <p>Wee referre our actions to the Princes will, the Prince by the direction of God, who ſince he is the gouernour of bothe actions, I dare auowe thei are not vicious.</p>
               <p>But you maie obiect that in proude attemptes of Princes, the Soldiour is ſtill preſent, not reſpctyng the cauſe, but his owne profite. Truely in iniurious cauſes I knowe that for certaine, the Soldiour is as contrary to the Warre as the beſt, who by proofe (and not by geſſe) conclude of the euente of the battaile, when the cauſe proceedeth of a wrongfull grounde, not like the eDuine who will continue his errours without controlement, nor like the Lawyer, who of purpoſe will take a wrongfull cauſe, to cozin his Client of his coyne.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:14"/>
               <p>If then warres be lawfull, warriours are not illegitimate: if in generall, the profeſſion is to be liked of, then can you but finde fault with perticuler men, and if ſo you minde to nippe me, neither Maiſter Deuine ſhall ſcape ſcotfree with his ſmooth lookes, nor Maiſter Lawyer with his glozes: for this I dare auowe, that if eche of our liues be lookt into, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour is as ſurely tied to all vertuous actions as any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion what ſo euer. In the choyce of a Soldiour, we doe not onely regarde the abilitie of his bodie, but the qualitie of the mynd, for if Religion, circumſpection, preuention, counſaill, experience by longe practiſe, zeale, faithfull performaunce of promiſe, reſolutneſſe in attemptes, continencie in life, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to ſatiſfie be not in him that would enter the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, truely the charge will be ill lookte into, neither is ſuche a one to be admitted in choyce, then if a Soldiour of iudgement be had, when he is imployde, howe liues he in the feelde, in the feare of God, not aſſured of his life from one hower to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abſtinent in diet, hard lodgyng, diligent to pleaſe, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to correct, both handes, thoughtes, and all are occupied: ſo that neither leiſure ſerues him to be idely occupied, nor the ſeueritie of the Captaine admits him to runne aſtraie. Well then, ſince it ſo fallethe out that ſuch thei ſhould bee, and thus thei are imployed, you muſt confeſſe that ſome there are or els the name and title ſhould bee hardly beſtead: For the bad, it maie be thei borrow ſome of their errours from you, you are ſo priuie to their eſcapes.</p>
               <p>But me thinkes your iudgement in diſpoſition of Nature, whereas you make the whole ſorte of Soldiours raſhe, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, bloudie mynded, and murtherous is but very bad: truely if thei ſhould bee raſhe, it is nothyng but in venturyng their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for you that hate them: for if thei were not gouerned, their ſucceſſe ſhould bee more infortunate then it is. If rebellious, truely <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had not conquered ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, ſubdued ſo many Kyngdomes, and ouercome ſo many Nations, and as it were but with a handfull of his <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Gretians.</hi> If bloudy mynded, why then ſpared <hi>Ceaſar</hi> thoſe Senators and Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom bothe by their
<pb facs="tcp:16402:14"/> owne hand writynges and often attemptes, he well knewe to be the followers of <hi>Pompei</hi> and his capitall enemies. If mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous, how often might the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armies haue worthely ſpoyled the whole Ilande of <hi>Creat,</hi> whiche not onely had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered many of their Families with the ſworde, but alſo rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt them more then fiue tymes. If Incontinent, what cauſed <hi>Scipio</hi> to redeliuer that noble yong Virgine, who for her paſſyng beautie and greate admiration of perſon, was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him as a rare gift, <hi>Scipio</hi> hymſelf amazed at the ſight, would yet deliuer her to <hi>Luceius,</hi> to whom ſhe was eſpouſed, and gaue hym alſo for a Dowrie the golde that her Parentes had brought to redeeme her. If couetous, how fell it out that after <hi>L. Mummius</hi> had taken <hi>Corinthe,</hi> and adorned all <hi>Italy</hi> with the riches of that Spoyle, keepyng ſo little to his owne vſe, that the Senate was faine for very neede, to giue Dowrie to his Daughter of the common Treaſure. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that either you can obiect againſt vs of your owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or alledge by your readyng, but I haue ſalued it vp, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſonable demonſtration, or ſufficient inſtaunce. And to ſpeake my conſcience, I know not the beſt of you, if Warre ſhould waite on you, that would not crouche to haue a Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours countenaunce, and bende if he beckoned.</p>
               <p>But why is he not liked of with the Religious, becauſe he can not finde in his harte to colour an errour: and wherefore is he diſcommodious to the Lawyer, for that he abridgeth hym of conuenient tyme, to practiſe his corruption. Thus the poore Soldiour ſtandeth in harde tearmes you maie ſee (Religious Gentleman) when he ſhall bee backbited of thoſe, who moſte leudly gouerne them ſelues: and bee condemned by ſuche as haue greateſt neede of amendment.</p>
               <p>But what is he (I praie you) that is ſpoyled by the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our but the Enemie: whom if he ſhould ſuffer to proſper in his wealth, the continuaunce of trouble would decaie our owne ſtate, and we might ſuffer others to be riche to make our ſelues poore, miniſtryng our enemies fewell, to ſet our ſelues on fire, and like innocent babes, bring our Maiſter a rodd to beate our owne tailes.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:15"/>
               <p>But this let I willyngly ſlippe, giuyng the ignoraunt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue to correct what thei knowe not, then openyng thoſe experimentes that tyme hath driuen into me by many occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I might make them note that whiche if thei knewe, thei would neuer well imploye. But for that I haue learned ſome one poinct of Rethoricke of you both, I will now approue it if I can, openyng a little the eſcapes of bothe your two profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo that in findyng many errours in you, I maie the better colour myne owne.</p>
               <p>And firſt for you Maiſter Cleargie man, thus muche muſt I craue, that as liberall I maie ſpeake what I thinke, as you what you pleaſe, ſo doubt I not, but to proue you as erreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious as the beſt, and the Lawyer as lawleſſe as the moſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie is the badge of your profeſſion, or els <hi>Pope Ione</hi> could not haue a yong Monk in her belly, nor ſo many Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men combred with yong Maidens firſt children.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Libertines</hi> as you call them, the <hi>Protestantes</hi> I meane (for amongſt thoſe in my tyme I haue beene conuerſaunt) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thei maie perhappes in pointes of Deuinitie bee farre from you as you thinke, and though the errors wherewith you charge them be aboue my reache, yet truely as touchyng their life, I haue not founde them ſo leude, and yet hauyng ſinned are ſo little corrected.</p>
               <p>Nay, this errour is not onely perpetrated by your ſelues, but alſo wincked at in others, where if a man bee neuer ſo ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtious, he maie bee aſſoyled for ſiluer, and a dubble Ducket (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you) will releaſe more Synnes in a moment, then the wickedeſt man maie commit in his whole life: ſo that you who ſhould reſtraine, graunt libertie: and for a priuate gaine vndoe many, whiche led by fonde luſtes haue ſmall regarde of them ſelues.</p>
               <p>If I were as priuie to your Bookes as your ſelues, and could reporte vnto you the moſt notable miſdeedes of other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as I can make open ſome of our tyme, neither would you ſit to heare my long diſcourſe, nor my voyce able to ſerue me to finiſhe out my tale. But touchyng your liues this I finde, who deſpiſeth ſinne moſt, followeth it a little, and though in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:16402:15"/> face of the worlde ſome of you can not brooke to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted couetous, yet if a priuate commoditie lighten in your lappes, you will be as readie to catche as the beſt, and with as faire ſpeeches to flatter for commoditie as the moſt. You are lime fingered for Liuynges to catche them ere thei fall: yet if a Lay man bee but a little couetous, he were beſt to amende for feare of condemnation: Nay, not onely are you couetous but bloud ſuckers, not ſatiſfied with the bloud of the father, but workyng reuenge vpon the very harmeleſſe infauntes his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as did <hi>Rogerius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldinus,</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Piſanum,</hi> toward <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>golinus,</hi> whom when with his three children he had long time kept in priſon, and fed hym with hope of preſent libertie, if ſo he would make the ſaied Archbiſhoppe priuie, to certaine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whiche he had hidden: whiche when he had confeſſed, and the Biſhop hauyng got the money, he not onely broke his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but alſo ſtarued hym and his three children moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie to death: whiche fact, the worlde doeth not onely wonder at, but alſo abhorre the wicked practiſes of ſuche villanie.</p>
               <p>Some of you are <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> falling from the faith, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> a Prieſt in <hi>Cilicia</hi> in my memorie, who for that he was wrongfully depriued of his Archdeaconrie, bounde hymſelf to the Deuill, that if he would reſtore him to his former dignitie, he would become his body and ſoule: afterward beyng againe in his preſent place of honour, he began vehemently to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed in mynd, with the combraunce of his owne conſcience, and with teares ſeekyng the fauour of the Almightie, he was mercifully ſaued and deliuered. Theſe and ſuche like ſorte of men are you, and yet men muſt bee tongue tied in reprouyng you, and you liberall in ſpeakyng what you pleaſe: but as plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is my profeſſion, ſo plainely haue I opened my mynde, meanyng a little to quite the ſpeeches of <hi>Signior Sandalio:</hi> he is a Lawyer, and I would bee lothe to dye in his debt, becauſe myne heires might not be troubled after my deceaſe. Of hym ſelf I accompt thus, he may be good, but for the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his profeſſion, thei are ſtarke naught in that thei are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous: for if corruption were not in the lawe, his profeſſion were not gainefull: For if ſo bee the lawe be certaine in it ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:16"/> why ſhould Iudgement bee delaied: If bent to doe right, why are ſo many poore men wronged: If grounded on conſcience, why is it parciall. But if the vſe of the thyng bee onely ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the faulte is in the Lawyer: Then thus it falleth out, that he who knoweth the will of his Maiſter and doeth it not, ſhould be beaten with many ſtripes, how like you this Cannon Maiſter Doctor?</p>
               <p>I remember as I trauailed to <hi>Athens,</hi> and being deſirous to ſee the Monumentes there, it was my happe by a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of myne (that ſmelt ſomethyng out of your dealinges) to bryng me to the Aulter of <hi>Minerua,</hi> by whiche oftentymes Pleaes were maintained on bothe parties: in which place, we founde two ſiluer Celles, hauyng on eche of them, their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inſcriptions: on the one was written, <hi>The Pulpit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> on the other, <hi>The Cell of Impudencie.</hi> A ſtraunge thyng it is to ſee, that ſo many ages paſt ſince the ſettyng vp of theſe, yet the vyces are not ceaſed, ſince in all whatſoeuer you reaſon of, either you are reprochfull or impudent: reprochfull, in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing onely on reporte: Impudent, in maintainyng naught but heareſaies. For vs Soldiours, admit our ſwordes faſten on the Enemie, yet venture wee our liues for the ſauegarde of our freendes: you neither haue reſpect of freend nor familiare, but ſo you maie profite your ſelues, you ſpare not to eate your Clientes out of houſe and home.</p>
               <p>But where as you would perſwade me by the fauour that the Emprour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> ſhewed to a Lawyer, if by that it were to bee concluded, that the Lawyer is more excellent, if fauour bee that you take holdfaſt on, neither you can bee admitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Soldiour, nor the Deuine take place before a Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: For you, one Emperour ſerues your turne, but looke but from the firſt foundation of this famous Citie, and you ſhall finde that the Soldiour was he that defended the State: the Soldiour was he that made <hi>Rome</hi> notable: yea, the Soldiour was onely he that had the creation of the Emperours. In the loſſe of a Soldiour, how mourned <hi>Iulius Ceaſer,</hi> whom not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he buried with bitter teares beyng dead, but alſo aliue bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited with great honours.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:16"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompei</hi> the great, built the Citie of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> to no other end but to harbour Soldiours, yea, our moſt notable gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this Empire, accompted of a Soldiour as of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in miſfortunes, and in attemptes: of you, but as his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, to confirme but what he pleaſe. Perhappes for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynyng of a good Plea, the Lawyer maie get a little popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler praiſe, but we for ſubduyng of an Enemie to <hi>Rome,</hi> had the benefite of a triumphe.</p>
               <p>Some of your Oratours for their preſumptions haue been cut of, moſt of our Soldiours for their deſertes, haue had their ſtatues ſet vp in the marked place.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Haniball</hi> knocked at <hi>Rome</hi> gates, why preuailed you not by eloquence, why confounded you not by Religion: Alas the while, your Cake was dowe, and had not the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our giuen the enemie the repulſe, your actions had been ſcarce ſaileable. While the Soldiour gouerned, peace was as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull as now it is: the reuenewes of <hi>Rome</hi> greater then now thei be: the exceſſe of <hi>Rome</hi> leſſer then now thei are.</p>
               <p>In our tyme of gouernment, <hi>Rome</hi> was renowned for her Iuſtice and faithfull lawes: Now, when the ſworde is in the hande of the Religious and ciuill Mageſtrate, <hi>Rome</hi> is noted for exceedyng vice.</p>
               <p>In the daies of <hi>Traiane,</hi> other Countreis ſought their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes from <hi>Rome:</hi> In theſe latter tymes <hi>Rome</hi> is accompted lawleſſe of all the worlde.</p>
               <p>Now for the Cleargie man, what maie he vaunt of, when he only defendeth Religion but with his tongue, but the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour in daunger and hazarde of his life. For the Lawyer, you can not bryng him to ſpeake at the Barre but with a great fee, where the poore Soldiour his hyre is but eight pence for the very day ſeruice he looſeth his life: And whether is he more worthie that if he bee imployed, it is but proulyng with his pen for priuate pence, or he that opoſeth hymſelf with his Pike for publique profite. So that for the ſake, bothe of Deuine and Lawyer, yea, for the maintenaunce of the whole State we venture our liues: and yet for all this let Peace ſmile on <hi>Rome</hi> a little, and Soldiours be vnneceſſarie.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:17"/>
               <p>And ſeyng it now coms in queſtion, what profeſſion is moſt worthie, of ſondrie men I haue heard ſondrie opinions.</p>
               <p>Kyng <hi>Dridanias</hi> was wont to ſaie to the <hi>Cicilians,</hi> that to the ſacrificyng Prieſtes of the Temple moſt honour was due. <hi>Bryas</hi> Kyng of <hi>Argiues,</hi> gaue moſte honour to the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> that read in Schooles. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romaines,</hi> was of opinion that he was worthie of moſt reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whom had happened the victorie of any famous Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. But <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> ordained amongſt the <hi>Phinetiens,</hi> that in a Commonweale, ſuche ſhould be honoured, who in the tyme of Peace entertained the State in tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in the furie of Warre, was founde a valiaunt Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the limites and liberties of his Countrey. And I praie (Maiſter Deuine) what wantes he in worthineſſe, who defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Religion with the loſſe of his life as the Soldiour, of him who doth but coate it doune in his quiet Studie as the Deuine. And good Maiſter Lawyer, whether is he moſt beneficiall to the Citizen, that defendeth hym in reſt vpon the fronter of his enemies as the Warriour, or he that cozins hym of his coyne within the Citie walles as the Lawyer.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, bothe to the Deuine and Lawyer, this I add, that ſince thei bee ſo perfect in life and exquiſite in liuyng, I would I were ſuche a one as they thinke themſelues to bee, and not as they are.</p>
               <p>So that noble Gentleman to whom the iudgement of this controuerſie belongeth, I am to referre all to your derection: aſſuryng you this, that although my tale bee more blunt then theſe Oratorious Deuines, yet it might pleaſe you to gather of my concluſions as you pleaſe, and to giue your iudgement as the equitie of the cauſe requireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides,</hi> hauing heard the ſundrie and ſeuerall diſcources of eche of theſe <hi>Signiors,</hi> and perceiuing that it fell to his turne to conclude, beſpake hym thus.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, my ignoraunce in eche of your profeſſions, my want of knowledge of the faſhions of this State, the vnſtable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plations which now gouerne my mynd, were reaſons enough (if you knew them) to miſlike of my iudgement: yet ſince it pleaſed you to picke me out as an Arbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in ſo ambiguous a cauſe, as my little ſkill will ſerue me, I will make recapitulation of your Obiections, and make you breefly priuie to my concluſion.</p>
               <p>This Religious Gentleman (in myne opinion) very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, both by Prophane and Eceleſiaſticall examples, hath maintained the dignitie of his profeſſion, and condemned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections bothe of Soldiour and Lawyer.</p>
               <p>The learned Ciuilian hath both aunſwered the Obiections were laied againſt hym, and inuerted them againſt his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, bothe of you conclude againſt the Soldiour, who though in bare tearmes he maintained a ſufficient cauſe, yet certainely he hath painted out bothe the Deuines and Lawyers imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in approued colours. Generally I finde this, Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe is bothe in the Cleargie man, Lawyer, and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: Exceſſe in Deuine, Lawyer, and Soldiour: yea, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of honour, bothe in Deuine, Lawyer, and Soldiour. I accompt the Deuine the very onely man to bee honoured if he liue well: The Lawyer to be wondred at if he iudge well: And yet the Soldiour not to be inferiour for he defendeth well.</p>
               <p>I can not tell what Soldiours bee in <hi>Rome,</hi> neither am I priuie to their abuſe: but what thei are in <hi>Genoua</hi> well I wot, where as not onely exceſſe by a Soldiours meanes was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but alſo the whole State worthely counſailed by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Captaine. If therefore, I ſhould reſolue with my ſelf, to giue iudgement on either partie, either the Deuine might correct me in diſplacyng hym, or the Lawyer condemne me in
<pb facs="tcp:16402:18"/> preferryng the Soldiour, or the Soldiour miſlike me in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting you both. Whervpon, ſith vnperfectly from my youth vp hetherto I haue alwaies iudged of colours, I would if I might ſo order my ſelf now (hauyng ſeene ſomewhat) that in pleaſing you all I might yet preferre the truth. Your vertues in eche profeſſion are fewe, your vices too many, but ſith your errours are more in number then your good qualities, your good is ſimple bad in that it conquereth not the worſe.</p>
               <p>When firſt I attempted Iourney towardes this famous Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> noated and renowned through all the worlde, I thought verelie that neither the Cleargie man ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencious he was ſo deuine, nor the Lawyer couetous he was ſo lookt into, nor the Soldeour diſſolute, where is or ſhould be ſo much diſcipline. But nowe when I fall in companie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Citizens, I finde reported <hi>Rome</hi> for vertues, is now the verie <hi>Rome</hi> that is vicious, for great muſt the errours bee in the ſtate, where bothe Deuine Lawyer and Soldiour are altogither diſſolute.</p>
               <p>I remember in our Cronicles of <hi>Spayne,</hi> when couetous Preſidentes ſent from this Citie did gouerne vs, oppreſſyng vs with exactious, and ſuckyng the marrowe of our wealthe from the bodie of our Commanweale, we had alwaies redreſſe here: this place was the nurſe of reformed iuſtice throughout the whole world, but ſithe the members now are ſo farre gone from them ſelues, as that thei ſlaunder the heade, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ingenerall by their perticuler errours note out the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities of <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſee well old iuſtice is baniſhed, and thoſe that once gaue Lawes to others, ought now to bee reſtrained and brideled them ſelues, whervppon brefely thus I conclude, that ſince the controuerſie betwixt you is for the ſuperioritie of the perſon, and not the dignitie of the ſubiecte, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine is vnworthie, ſquaryng from his profeſſion, the Lawyer not alowed of, beyng inconſtant in his owne decrees, and the Soldiour leſſe to be diſcommended then you bothe.</p>
               <p>And that you maie ſee I ground not vppon light oppinion, giue but eare a little to my tompariſon, and I doubt not but to reſolue non although you ment to doubt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:18"/>
               <p>It befortuned that three <hi>Scithian</hi> Brothers after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the King their father, fell in controuerſie for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, eche of them aleadgyng his owne worthines both in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, valew, and nobilttie: the cauſe beyng doubtfull, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of the State referred it to a Kyng, a neighbour of theirs, that he might decide the controuerſie, he concluded thus, that eche of them armed with Croſbowe and arrowe, ſhould be ſet in a conuenient place, and he of the three Bretheren whiche could moſte neareſt ſtrike the harte of the dead Kyng, (whoſe bodie to that purpoſe was taken out of the Sepulcher and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to a Tree) ſhould ſucceede hym in the Empire: Vppon this concluſion, the eldeſt Brother takyng leuell, ſtrooke his father in the breaſt, yet miſſyng the harte: The middlemoſt in the throte: But now the tyme ſeruyng for the yonger Brother to trie his maiſterie, he deteſtyng to perpetrate ſo great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, caſt awaie his Bowe and Arrowe, deſpiſing rather the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a Prince, then willyng to commit ſuche notable and vnnaturall ennormitie: The whiche the barbarous Kyng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, he not onely preferred hym to the Kyngdome, but alſo worthely recompenſed hym with condigne honours.</p>
               <p>So fareth it at this preſent with you three Gentlemen, your father (I meane your Countrey whereof you be children and members, I meane <hi>Rome</hi> that now is) is dead to that it hath been, hauyng buried his manifolde titles of renowne in the errours of his ſondrie vngracious Citizens: you his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtriuyng for ſucceſſion, that is, indeuouryng for ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the State, are to heare the awarde of me a barbarous Iudge, the whole fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> hath beene laied for you to leuell at: the eldeſt (I meane the Deuine) hath pearced the breaſt, hauyng falne into many errours, as Couetouſneſſe, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie, miſconſtruyng of the Scriptures and what not, diſplaced one of the Pillers of the State, I meane Militarie profeſſion: Your ſecond brother the Lawyer hath ſtriken bothe necke and breaſt, not onely beyng corrupt in hymſelf, but alſo corruptyng his Science, and with the eldeſt conſented to the baniſhyng of all warlike defence: The yonger brother, though willyng to poſſeſſe, yet loth to wound his fathers corſe, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:16402:19"/> but the Deuine and Lawyers ſeuerall vices, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baniſhyng them from any title in the State, that is not vouchſauyng to laie bloudie handes on his father, and therfore a comparatis I conclude, he is at this tyme to haue the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in the cauſe, vntill the Deuine liue better, and the Lawyer amende his miſdemeanour.</p>
               <p>Thus Gentlemen, you maie perceiue my concluſion, if I haue erred in ought, beare with my Imperfections, I meant well, and as I thought ſo I ſpeake: If my iudgement pleaſe not you, I am to referre it to a better learned then my ſelf: and Gentleman Soldiour, you are preferred but with a Prouiſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe three admittyng very well of <hi>Simonides</hi> diſcourſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to their ſeuerall affaires, onely the Soldiour deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the varietie of his wit, diſcourſed thus.</p>
               <p>Gentleman ſtraunger, your plauſible iudgement of late throughly perſwades me of your bryngyng vp, and your well ordred behauiour aſſureth me of your worthie and noble birth, and makes me the willynger, either in courteſie to doe you pleaſure, or if my ſeruice maie any waies ſtande you in ſteade, I am readily willyng to aunſwere your expectation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it ſhall pleaſe you in ought to imploye me, you ſhall not be more earneſt to require, then I willyng to performe.</p>
               <p>Truely ſir (aunſwered <hi>Simonides</hi>) neither will I let ſlippe your proffered courteſie, nor be vnthankfull for your courtlike affabilitie: If therefore it ſhall pleaſe you to accompanie a ſtraunger, to ouerſee the Monumentes of this Citie, I ſhall in this courteſie be greatly beholdyng vnto you. In breefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng both agreed, <hi>Don Pierro de faragoſa,</hi> conueyed hym to the moſt auncient and renowned Monumentes that were to bee ſeen: at the laſt attainyng the Market place, thei eſpied a great aſſembly of Doctors, Prelattes, and diuers other Citizens: ſome pleaſauntly diſpoſed amongſt them ſelues: ſome others, greeuouſly complainyng vppon ſome iniurie, and to the ende thei might knowe the cauſe of this turmoyle, the Soldiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded what might be the cauſe: to whom it was aunſwered, that if it pleaſed hym to looke on <hi>Paſquius</hi> Piller, he ſhould perceiue the whole matter. Wherevpon, takyng <hi>Simonides</hi> by

               <p>I doubt not noble Gentleman, but that the renowne of the noble Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> hath bin brought to your eares, whoſe power and authoritie in this Countrey, hath not onely beene long famous by deſcent, but alſo in euery mans mouth, from thence tooke I myne ofſpryng, beeyng onely Daughter and heire of <hi>Lodouico Gonſaſy,</hi> who in my prime of youth, at ſuche tyme as my yong yeares were mellowed with the cheefeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Nature, was ſought to in waie of Mariage by two yong <hi>Italian</hi> Princes: the one the Prince of <hi>Aucona,</hi> called <hi>Vaſcalio,</hi> the other <hi>Saluanio,</hi> Sonne to the Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice:</hi> eche of theſe with many amorous interſceſſions, inceſſauntly laie vpon me for Mariage, and continually ſolicited my father for his fauour: who tenderly louyng me his yong Daughter called <hi>Priſeilla,</hi> and vnwillyng not to marche me contrary to myne owne likyng, made me free to take my choyce, and to aunſwer the expectation of theſe two yong Princes according
<pb facs="tcp:16402:23"/> to myne owne fancie. Bothe theſe yong Princes I fed with delaies, neither preferryng the one, nor refuſing the other. Wherevpon, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſcalio</hi> wearied with my ouerburdenſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laie, began to waxe ſickly: whiche opertunitie ſeruyng <hi>Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> very well, he ceaſed not with continuall courtyngs to coaſt my affections, not pretermittyng any opertunitie, either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by preſent, or winne fauour by ſeruice. Notwithſtandyng, conſidering how ſerious the cauſe was I had in hand, and how daungerous it were to repulſe either the one or the other, I thought it moſt conuenient to make a ſtaie for a ſpace, in which tyme, either the fancie of the one might be leſſened, or the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection of the other extinguiſhed: But alas the while, as thei that are ſtung with <hi>Scorpions,</hi> are wont from the harmer to ſeeke their recure, ſo theſe twoo noble Nouices, hauyng their faithfull affections fixed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gliſtering gleames of my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beautie, thought no other meanes might be had to remedy their miſſe, but only by the attaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of my eſpeciall fauour.</p>
               <p>Alas that ſimple feminine beautie, ſhould ſo bewitch reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Nobilitie, or ſuche miſfortunes ſhould befall, by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng my declinyng fauour.</p>
               <p>Theſe yong Gentlemen, deſiſted not their attempt: for what the one in perſon preferred with humble ſubmiſſon, the other proffered in papers with a faithfull aſſuraunce of loyaltie. In breefe the coales of fancie were kindled, and ſuche vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humours at laſt began to gouerne myne actions, that the fire whiche faine I would haue raked vp in the embers of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, brake out with furie to myne owne confuſion: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng altogether affectionate towardes <hi>Saluanio,</hi> who (as ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſerued) was alwaies preſent with fewell to encreaſe my fire, helped by opertunitie, and ouercome by his importunitie, at the laſt I yeelded to the aſſault, promiſing hym the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of my hart, if he would ſo moderate himſelf by a twelue monethes ſpace, as no one token of accordaunce, ſhould fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my priuate intent: and to the ende that our vndoubted aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce ſhould neuer bee ſeperated, I imparted vnto hym a Gemme of approued valewe, aſſuryng hym that the poſſeſſion of me, belongeth to him and no other, who continued the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

               <p>But at laſt, the other noble yong Gentleman, hauyng con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with hymſelf, that abſence breedeth forgetfulneſſe, and delaie was vnneceſſarie in cauſes of Loue, betooke hymſelf to walke abroade, and watchyng ſtill for ſome conuenience to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his mynd, eſpecially incited therevnto by the abſence of his riuall foe <hi>Saluanio,</hi> he vnfortunatly on a tyme found me alone in a priuate meditation of my conſtant Louer, vtterly voyde of myndyng hym, and beyng helped by this opertunitie, he boldly incountered me thus.</p>
               <p>Madame, the long ſorrowes I haue conceiued by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, and the earneſt zeale that attendeth on my harte, the true loyaltie wherewith I honour you, and the feruent affectes of Loue whiche altogether inforce my thraldome, binde me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche your fauour, that either by your graunt of grace I may bee reuiued now almoſt dead with diſpaire: or if your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be ſuche as no fauour will be had, I maie be adiudged, the moſt infortunate Louer that liueth: Good Ladie, thoſe your glorious eyes, theſe your exquiſit lineamentes, that your ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behauiour haue applied ſuche an impreſſion to my harte, as neither Arte can eate out the corroſiue by counſaile, nor life continue if you contemne: For how can the Moone glad the darkſome night, if her borrowed light of the Sunne be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, or the harte continue in good eſtate, if the vitall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers be determined. Can I liuyng by your gracious looke, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe but dye by your frowne. Alas, that harte whiche eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeldeth to like, can hardly brooke to neglect, and that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe whiche hath wounded myne eye with reflection, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be loſened but by the aſſpect of beautie: So that in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, I am tied to ſuch extremitie, either to liue a dying crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beeyng manaced by your cruell contempt, or els dye on myne owne ſworde, to auoyd the furie of an euerlaſtyng Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.

               <p>Truely Madame, the miſfortunes of theſe two worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, togither with your reſolution, makes me preſuppoſe, that all honourable affection, is here onely in <hi>Jtaly,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant retribution, in the ladies of this countrie, I finde my ſelf benefited in this my miſfortune, that ſeeyng feminine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much, I maie valiauntly continue the aſſault, though hetherto by repulſe I haue been ſtill afflicted, and though the breach be alredie made, and the aſſaylaunt entered, yet to keep one ſkonce ſure againſt the ſowers of diſdaine.</p>
               <p>Happie is <hi>Signior <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſcalio,</hi> (in my fancie noble Lady) who hath determined his Tragedie, and left a ſinguler confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his conſtancie, euen before his eyes who onely was the ſole miſtris of his harte, leauyng that perſon here beyng dead, to blazon out his renowne, whom liuing he honoured with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yall and conſtant ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Straunge is it to ſee, the ſtratagemes of this life, how one death aſwell deuoureth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſureſt conſtant, as moſt diſloiall, one mould vouchſafeth both noble and in noble, whereas the deſart of the one required diefiyng, the eſcape of the other ſhamful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and ſcarce worthy the benefite of ſepulture.</p>
               <p>And wonderfull are theſe effectes, when nature ſhal vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to admit, that is vnnaturall towardes nature. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of your affections (I meane <hi>Vaſcalio</hi> and yours) altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrarious, yet were thei one, for what you wiſhed, your poore ſuppliaunt deſired, yea, what you imagined to diſpoſſeſſe him, he turned to the honouryng of you.</p>
               <p>But I ſee, the opening of greene woundes is daungerous,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:29"/> and the remembraunce of miſfortunes newly paſt, procure a bitter diſgeſtion of anticendentes: wherevppon (Madame) I had rather bee ſilent to ſlake your ſorowe, then taulkatiue to augment myne owne greefe: yet I beſech you, beare with my preſumption, and vouchſafe humble thankes at my handes for your doolefull diſcourſe, and farther if it pleaſe you, let me not want your direction, toward the accompliſhing of my iourney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madamiſella Priſcilla,</hi> allowyng of <hi>Simonides</hi> diſcourſe, yet altogither vnwillyng he ſhould long abide with her, after ſhe had with honourable ſemelines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uaied him to a path waie towarde <hi>Naples,</hi> and directed hym in what ſhe might, toward the accompliſhyng of his deſire, not forgettyng to learne out his name, birthe, cauſe of trauaill, and ſuche like wherein ſhe ſtoode in doubt, ſhe courteouſly gaue hym this farewell at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng.</p>
               <p>Sith Fortune (amorous <hi>Spanyard</hi>) hath with like repulſe afflicted thee as it hath <hi>Vaſcalio,</hi> ſhe hath to this ende ſent thee hether to learne of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſcalio,</hi> and if thy Miſtris contumacie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine thy courteſie, doubt thou not but ſhe maie bee made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of my hard happe: Perſeuer thou therefore (noble <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>) in faithfull affection, ſo in the ende thou ſhalt reape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne for thy labour. This ſaied, ſhe courteouſly betooke her to her vowed Manſion, and after ſome reuerent ſalutations preſented by <hi>Simonides,</hi> he paſſed forward on his Iourney, and not pretermittyng the cautions the courteous Ladie had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed hym, he at laſt ouercame the tediouſneſſe of the ſolitarie Deſert, and came into the high waie toward <hi>Naples.</hi> In iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying he met with diuers, who vppon ſundrie affaires were trauellyng to that Citie, and as diligence ouercommeth all te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe, ſo with the good companie he met withall, and the expedition thei altogether made, thei might behold the Toune whiche ſo long thei had wiſhed for.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IMONIDES</hi> beyng thus ariued at <hi>Naples,</hi> a famous Citie and Towne of Garriſon, was no ſoner entered the Port, but he was ſtaied by the court of Guarde, and was preſented before the Viceroy of the Citie, who finding out by his reports, that he was a trauelling Straunger, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hym courteouſly to bee conueied to a conuenient lodgyng in the Citie, where he might imploye hymſelf as he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides</hi> repoſing hymſelf for that night, on the morrowe queſtionyng with his Hoſt what Straungers were habitaunt in the Citie, he reported vnto hym, that amongſt the <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> (a Secte of Friers inſtituted by <hi>Bembo</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>) there was at that inſtaunt inueſted a Gentleman of Nobilitie, a <hi>Spanyard</hi> once renowned for his holy life, though heretofore he had bin a Courtier of ſinguler brauerie within that Citie, and hauyng learned his name, whiche was <hi>Fredericke de Cicuta,</hi> he likewiſe ſought the meane to finde hym out, and beyng pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his ſpeech by the licence of the <hi>Superintendent</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſt,</hi> he ſaluted hym thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Signior,</hi> beeyng ariued a Straunger in this Citie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng by reporte of your beyng here, who are (as I am enformed) my Countrey man, I thought it a poinct of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to acquaint my ſelf with one of myne owne Nation, and a parte of ciuilitie, to viſite a Gentleman of ſuch renowne as I vnderſtand you to be of, willyng, if you haue any ſeruice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to commaunde me, if it bee your pleaſure at any tyme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me, you ſhall finde me more willing to performe, then you readie to commaunde.</p>
               <p>Frier <hi>Fredericke</hi> hauing giuen him the <hi>Baſeles manes</hi> (after
<pb facs="tcp:16402:30"/> the faſhion of our <hi>Napolitan</hi> Courtiers) aunſwered hym thus. It can not bee courteous Gentleman, that my Countrey man a ſtraunger, ſhould want any ſeruice I maie accompliſhe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, perceiuing you to be a Gentleman, and willing to grow into the high way of experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wherfore if you pleaſe to walke with me, into my priuate Cell, you ſhall accordyng to myne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie be welcomed, and if in the Citie I can doe you any cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, doubt not but you ſhall commaunde me.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, thei bothe paſſyng to the fornamed place, and hauyng diſcourſed of the cauſualties of their Countrey, they recommended eche vnto other, the originall cauſe of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, of their birthe, abode, and ſuche like: in the ende, Frier <hi>Fredericke,</hi> demaunded of <hi>Simonides,</hi> the cauſe of his departing from <hi>Ciuill,</hi> and why he trauailed towardes <hi>Naples,</hi> whom <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> ſatiſfied thus.</p>
               <p>Religious Father, your reuerent eares ſhould hardly daine (conſidering the ſubiect) to vouchſafe the hearing of a diſcourſe ſo vnneceſſarie, eſpecially, ſince my cauſe of trauaile ſtandeth on ſuche nice pointes, as ere I had reſolued to departe <hi>Ciuill,</hi> I was almoſt at <hi>Rome.</hi> My yong yeares (as you ſee) ſubiect to ſundry impreſſions, at laſt tooke holdfaſt on vnſtaied Loue, and myne eyes beyng curious in regardyng Beautie, fixed them at laſt vnremoueably on the blaze of a faire Damoſell called <hi>Clarinda,</hi> whom (accordyng to cuſtome) when I had eft cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet neuer conquered, impacient of delaies, I deſperatly left <hi>Ciuill,</hi> trauailyng to vnknowne Cities, led by this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by ſight of many thyngs, I ſhould learne ſomething, and in returnyng home conſtaunt in loue, and accompanied with many good qualities, I ſhould be better welcomed to my <hi>Clarinda.</hi> On this ground I haue ſeen <hi>Ferrara,</hi> viſited <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> paſt through <hi>Genoua,</hi> attained <hi>Rome,</hi> where inticed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reporte of the nobilitie and courtlike behauiour of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> I am come hether to weete if the brauerie bee correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that I haue heard, the demeanure ſo commendable as it is eſteemed of. Theſe breefly are the cauſes of my trauaile, ſomewhat I haue ſeene els where, and now what I looke for here, if by your meanes I might, (good Countrey man) I
<pb facs="tcp:16402:31"/> would gladly accompliſhe.</p>
               <p>And was it Loue (noble <hi>Simonides</hi> ſaied <hi>Fredericke</hi>) that made you leaue <hi>Ciuill,</hi> truely an vniuſt cauſe to aduenture tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trauaile, for ſmall or no commoditie: It is a greate errour (Countrey man) that made you amorous: it was not the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe beautie of your Miſtris, the aluryng raies of her eyes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he exquiſite feature of her bodie that captiuated your ſences, but an idle mynde of yours, inclinyng to no good exerciſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainyng orderly aduertiſementes, which vouchſafed to follow ſuche inconſtant groundes as theſe be: for it neuer falleth out but where Idleneſſe is predominaunt, that Loue preuaileth: for where heauenly contemplation occupieth the mynde, and orderly functions employ the bodie, the ſoule diſdaineth to like of duſt and aſhes, the bodie ſubdued by diſcretion, becommeth not deſolute. If wee keepe as dutifull diſpoſitions of our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as the limitations of Nature hath preſcribed vs, our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſhould bee finiſhed in an inſtaunt, our vertues encreaſed euery hower: for as all thynges maie bee recouered but loſſe of tyme, ſo vnlawfull pleaſures ſhould bee no reaſonable mans companions.</p>
               <p>I haue knowne of many Louers thus muche, that for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſure in their youth, thei haue proued vnwildie men in their age: but for thoſe that in youth haue been Studientes in <hi>Philoſophi,</hi> in their declinyng yeares thei haue proued <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall,</hi> and not troubled with diſtempreture of bodies. If you knew therefore <hi>Simonides,</hi> what it is to compaſſe the tyme, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue ſhould preuaile though it aſſault you, nor vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures conquer you when you are well armed with happie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. For he that diſtinguiſheth tymes well, and compares the commoditie of his houres reading to his daies lotering, would wiſhe his daies ſpent in Loue, readyng howers: and repent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery minute let ſlippe, with a thouſand ſighinges. For by how muche we ouerpaſſe our daies in idle exerciſe, by ſo muche we abridge the limites of our happineſſe: &amp; by how much we aply our mynde to blinde and amorous actions, by ſo muche we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe our mynde of the moſt bleſſed benefites of reaſon. In ſtudiyng to attaine Loue, wee are recompenced with ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde:
<pb facs="tcp:16402:31"/> In ſtudiyng to poſſeſſe Vertues, what one thyng maie be compared to our bleſſedneſſe. In poſſeſſyng ſuche tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pleaſures, as Loue is, a man is enuied at by his Riuall: In attainyng the inſcrutable benefite of verteous &amp; ſacred know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a man is reuerenced euen by his Enuiers. So that you ſee, the ſlothfull amorous man, is tamed and made leſſe then a man by his follie and negligence, where contrarie, he is moſt happie and bleſſed, that fearyng to be idle, is not content to bee a man, and indeuouryng in honeſt exerciſes, is a demy God by his vertues.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Simonides,</hi> I ſpeake all this to this ende, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee thy follies, and in ſeeyng them ſubdue them in thy ſelf: for in thoſe onely actions, wee proue our ſelues reaſonable, wherein we ſubdue ſuche contrary affectes, as withſtande ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement, and maiſter thoſe fleſhly paſſions, as altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſeth our happineſſe: For it is a point of reaſon, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe good from ill, ſo is it the parte of a reaſonable man to followe the better and flye the worſe. Theſe conſidered (good Countrey man) for your firſt parte of trauaile you can not but confeſſe it to bee grounded on ſmall reaſon: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I will with you confirme this, that by it you haue gotten experience: and whereas here you are ariued to learne the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of Court, whatſoeuer by eye ſight your ſelf ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, I by my experience can alreadie laie open: and not onely deſcribe you a Courtier in all his colours, but alſo open vnto you the imperfections that proceede from their profuſedneſſe: wherevpon, if it pleaſe you to yeeld attentiue eare, I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to begin my Narration.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Naples</hi> here renowned by the excellencie of this <hi>Signior</hi> that now gouerneth it, hath incited many young men (hauyng the raine in their owne neckes) to reſorte hether, where bothe by the ſerenitie of the ayre, thei maie haue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of their health, and by the brauerie of the Court, ſatiſfie their youthly humours. Otherſome, by their fathers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in hope of preferment) are ſent hether to bee attendaunt on the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iceroy,</hi> who by their good deſeruynges, either are to growe in fauour, or by their valewe and force of Armes, are to
<pb facs="tcp:16402:32"/> be confirmed with Marciall honour. Theſe intentions, makes the Court here ſo ample as it is, and ſo accompted as it ſeemes to be: For the firſt ſorte of noble Courtiers, as their humours are, ſuche their retinewe is: vaine heades are attended on by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducyng Flatterers: Follies worke altogether maiſters with them: Faſhions make them of comely Perſonages diſguiſed Maſkers. Idleneſſe, of able Gentlemen laſciuious Mecocks: Their feates of Armes, are turned to a Sinquipace: Thei had rather tread a tricke of one and twentie follies, then performe an action that might increaſe honour.</p>
               <p>Suche are the diſpoſitions of theſe ſorte of Gentlemen, that if thei erre in ought, thei are ſoothed in the ſame: if thei delight to be praiſed, the Flatterer will preuaile: if to bee reuerenced, thei ſhall haue capp and curteſie: if for title of credite, thei ſhall bee worſhipped and reworſhipped: if laſciuious and wanton, thei ſhall want no priuie Brokers: if riotous, who doubtes but Spendthriftes will haunt them: if daintie in diet, thei muſt haue a Frenche Cooke: if faſhionatiue, the Towne ſhall bee ſought for an inuenting Tayler: So that at the laſt ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des purſe emptie, and very many are non ſuited of al their coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attire: and the Farmer in diſchargyng the Marchauntes bookes, hath either his Leaſe renued or continued for euer.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtraunge thyng to ſee, how in Courte our daintie Nobles braue it, deſiryng rather to feed their Miſtris eye with delicate aſpect, then maintaine the diſtreſſed Soldiour with neceſſarie prouiſion: yet in this, I altogether blame not the Gentleman, whereas (perhappes as Court faſhion is) pleaſing of humours is moſt profitable: he deſiryng to bee a Penifather will venture his ſtake amongſt the reſt, but where one ſpéedeth a hundred faile, who ouer runne with arerages, are faine them ſelues to pull downe their briſtles, and to ſettle their ſailes lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to auoyde the Perrie of perdition.</p>
               <p>Truely now adaies <hi>(Signior Simonides)</hi> the faſhion of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> is ſuche, as fauour preuaileth with many by occaſion, not by deſart: by opinion, not by worthineſſe: And now ſince peace makes all plentious, Gentlemen will bee delicate: Ladies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous: the Prince perhappes ſtudious. And though not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
<pb facs="tcp:16402:32"/> all ennormities, yet compaſſed about with many that bee enormous.</p>
               <p>Our Courtiers now adaies, from the practiſe of the Launce, haue learned to loue: perhappes in remembraunce of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer endeuours, thei will turnie a courſe or two to pleaſe their Miſtris: but for olde daylie experience, whiche inureth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to aſſaultes, alas, thei are to comberſome, we muſt none of them, but if our Miſtris like of a codpeece Dublet, it ſhall coſt them the ſettyng on but it ſhall bee had: If ſhort Breeches, all <hi>Padua</hi> ſhall be ſearched for them. So that now from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, our Italians haue ſtolne their portrature, and they muſt now bee pictured naked, with a paire of Sheares in his hande, thei are ſo combred with newe faſhions and inuentions. In the Court of <hi>Naples,</hi> now <hi>Ariſtides</hi> for his plaineſſe ſhall be thruſt out, and <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> for his niceneſſe preferred. <hi>Criſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> with his ſweete eloquence ſhall preuaile, where <hi>Cato</hi> with his ſowre cenſures ſhall be miſlikt. When <hi>Damocles</hi> flattereth faſteſt he ſhal be preferred ſoneſt, where if any ſeuere <hi>Caliſtines</hi> reprehended he ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Although in this Court we haue ſundrie wiſe men, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng maie ſlippe thei can not ſee all, and where ſo many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſo often debated, no maruaile though reaſon bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng abated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pithagoras</hi> with his owne hande, wrote this Inſcription on his Schoole doore.</p>

                  <l>Who ſo knoweth not what he ought to knowe, is a beaſt amongſt men,</l>
                  <l>He that knoweth no more then he hath need of, is a man amongſt beastes,</l>
                  <l>He that knoweth that maie be, is a God amongſt men.</l>

               <p>It maie well bee a iuſt Prince might preſcribe this before the Court of <hi>Naples,</hi> but ſhould he enter into the examination of the Premiſſes, I feare me he might worthely condemne the moſt, who ought to knowe that exceſſe is vnneceſſarie, and yet our Courtiers doe commonly vſe it, and therefore brutiſhe: Many we haue that knowe no more then thei neede of, and yet but men amongſt brute beaſtes: but for thoſe that knowe all
<pb facs="tcp:16402:33"/> thynges, thei are but <hi>Pauci quos equus amauit Jupiter at<expan>

               <p>Let <hi>Traian</hi> preſcribe good lawes for eternall memorie, and yet where are thei ſooner broken then in the Court of <hi>Traian.</hi> Let <hi>Marcus aurelius</hi> ſtore his Court with wiſemen, yet euen there thei waxe diſſolute. And our Court guiſe here is ſuche, that in ſhorte ſpace we learne to knowe what is ill, but for that is good, we can hardly compaſſe it in a long ſeaſon. And how can it otherwiſe bee, that where all thynges are miniſtred to pleaſe the appetite, that reaſon ſhould preuaile: where all ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to inuent vices, we ſhould admitt vertue: where all our exerciſes are amorous, any one endeuour ſhould be Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall: Cuſtome inuerteth all thynges: Errour deſtroyeth all thynges, where onely ſimilitudes ſerueth the Court, what ſhall become of ſubſtaunce.</p>
               <p>Truely if <hi>Catos</hi> cenſer, had as greate authoritie in our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Court as he had in <hi>Rome,</hi> and if the Animaduerſions of Idleneſſe, were as auſtere here as thei were in his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it was then, I feare me ſome of our nice Courtiers ſhould kiſſe the <hi>Marmotiue,</hi> and beare thoſe corrections, whiche be fitted their follies.</p>
               <p>In his gouernment, all <hi>Rome</hi> baniſhed Idleneſſe: in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, noted vices growe and encreaſe Idleneſſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, it proueth that the braueſt Soldiour, is become the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt Courtier, and the furie of the ſworde is ſupplied, with the fame of the tongue: the mediocritie in diet and attire, to banquettyng in diet and brauerie in attire. Thus our whole Courte by Idleneſſe is made diſſolute: by cuſtome corrupt: where faſhions fixe follie, follie breedes vanitie, bothe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt.</p>
               <p>This Courte in elder age, was accompted the Mother of Wiſemen, the ſtepdame of Fooles: where now, a Foole ſhall glorie of more fauour, then the Wiſeman of acceptaunce: And no maruell ſince the worlde as now runneth at this rate, that as Mothes eate the cloath, and the Cankerworme pearceth the Tree, ſo flatteryng <hi>Sicophantes</hi> beguileth all the worlde. But for thoſe ſortes that depende on their deſartes, alas the
<pb facs="tcp:16402:33"/> while, I pittie their miſfortunes, thei wantyng power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to maintaine a parte, are put backe from compaſſyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, and if in ſtriuyng to ariſe thei haue but one faune of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, thoſe eyes that looke into al procedinges, and are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full onely to their owne profites, will preuent them, turnyng them of with a little preferment, not ſufferyng them to riſe to hie, for lickyng the fatt from their fingers, ſo that now adaies Promotion is determined in ſuche ſorte, as fanſie rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the election then diſcretion, in ſo muche that deſarte maie now goe a beggyng when all the worlde is guided by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
               <p>But whereas we haue but lookt a little into the priuate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, attire, and externall practiſes of their life and founde ſo muche errour, if we but now conſider the inwarde diſpoſition of the mynde, of troth you maie wonder.

If <hi>Phaleris</hi> will torment, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> will inuent: If <hi>Aemilius</hi> will martir, <hi>Paterculus</hi> will miniſter: If <hi>Alexander</hi> will be ſtately, <hi>Photion</hi> will be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: If <hi>Domitius</hi> fooliſhe, <hi>Hipodamus</hi> will be franticke, euery greate mans vaine ſhall haue a follower, and by theſe ſteppes of ſoothing Gouerners phantaſies now adaies, our Courtiers ſeeke to clime, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any other action that is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: So though the honour thei attaine make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> renowned in the face of the world, yet the meanes wherewith thei attaine are odious in the opinion of the wiſeſt. For what can bee more diſcommendable, then for a noble mynd to applie it ſelf to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile functions? What booteth Nobilitie, where the man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes hymſelf abiect? If glorie amidſt the vniuerſall benefites of fortune be cheefeſt, (for that it is the onely recorde of vertue, and vertue by no other meanes is to bee atchiued but by honeſt endeuours) I count hym infortunate that by contrarious ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes would clime to it, and ſeeking by vniuſt meanes to attaine beyng vnmeete for it.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe honours that dependeth vppon the opinion of
<pb facs="tcp:16402:34"/> Princes, as it is conceiued ſo feareth it in an inſtaunt: Thoſe titles of renowne in true glorie paſſe by deſarte: in fained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment are committed by caſualtie: the proude borroweth the ſtate and title of the humble: the humble of the proude: For where the Iudgement is in an vndiſcreete eye, how can it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be, but that all thynges muſt paſſe by opinion. It was true honour grounded on deſarte, that preferred <hi>Fabius</hi> to the title of <hi>Maximus:</hi> It was the auſtere actions of <hi>Marilius,</hi> that made hym to bee tearmed <hi>Jmperioſus</hi> in vndoubted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne. Therefore we ſee <hi>Simonides,</hi> the preferment without counterfaite, but in fained and momentany glorie (which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no ſmall ſwaie in this Court) all runnes by heareſaies.</p>
               <p>But this I dare boldly affirme, that if honours were to bee compaſt by vices, as in olde <hi>Rome</hi> thei were by vertues, there would more proue honourable (in our Court of <hi>Naples</hi>) in one yeare, then <hi>Rome</hi> had of good men in a whole age.</p>
               <p>How many <hi>Democriti</hi> ſhould we haue, that would deride al men accomptyng them mad, when he hymſelf was out of his witt? How many <hi>Epicuri</hi> that are led altogether with ſenſuall luſt, yet diſdaine the ſtrickt life of others.</p>
               <p>Truely if our <hi>Napolitans,</hi> had euery parte of their bodies, accordyng to the number of faſhions they weare, they ſhould haue Flemiſhe heades to their Dutche hattes: Frenche faces to their marquiſotted cutt: Pariſian neckes to their Parris ruffes: Italian bodies to their bigge bellies: Millian buttocks to their mincyng Breeches: Spaniſh legges to their Spaniſh Stockynges: Engliſhe feete to their Engliſhe Pantoffies: And if euery Countrey for his faſhion might craue a member, I thinke it were more wiſedome in equall diſtribution of eche Countre is parte, then witt to acquaint our members with ſo many Countrey faſhions.</p>
               <p>Truely it were better for a Courtier with the <hi>Atlantibae,</hi> rather to want his name, then good nurture: for vnnamed his honour ſhall not grow in queſtion, but ſpoken of, his vices ſhall be noted.</p>
               <p>But to let ſlippe our men Courtiers, with their affectation of honour, with their vnorderly meanes to attaine renowne,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:34"/> let vs now turne to our Courtlike Ladies, and wee ſhall finde there was not ſo much varietie in the one, but there is twiſe as muche vanitie in the other: the Gentleman is not ſo fooliſhe, but the Gentlewoman is euen as fonde: ſo that bothe of them are coupled in a leaſe of agreeable follies: the one to followe, the other to intice. Theſe Damoſelles can make Emperours idle as <hi>Authony:</hi> Valiaunt men effeminate as <hi>Hercules:</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men diſſolute as <hi>Salomon:</hi> Eloquent men laſciuious as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius:</hi> their eyes haue power attractiue: thei neuer prie but thei pearce: neuer glaunce but thei conquer, ſo that none but <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,</hi> can abridge their ſleightes to entrap: nor ought but wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, preuaile againſt their ſugred inticementes. I haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen the braueſt Courtier in <hi>Naples,</hi> to daie brauely mounted traueſing the Streates, richly demeined, brauely attired, and beyng ouercome but by a glauncyng paſſion, the next daie in mynde malancholie: in habite mournefull: in gate inconſtant: nay, in all actions not hymſelf, ſuche pearce haue theſe Ladies eyes, and thei beſtowe them ſo cunningly, that makyng out their choyce on the Ideleſt, thei alwaies become conquerers. No Nouice maie ſcape their handes, but from Heauen with <hi>Prometheus</hi> he bringes away ſome flame: So that in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Court (I dare auowe) there are more at this inſtaunt ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, then of continent habitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madamiſella</hi> her ſelf what practiſeth ſhe not, this youth muſt bee her ſeruaunt and weare her colours, that Gentleman her Partner and weare her ſleeue, a third her Louer and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe vnchaſt bed pleaſures: And though the two firſt bee as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhe in their giftes as the laſt, yet thei both are forſt to hold the Candle, while the other offers to our Ladie. Suche bee theſe Gentlewomen, that thei haue tongues to traine, eyes to alure, bodies to performe: no opertunitie with them ſhall be let ſlippe for a pleaſure: nothing pretermitted to make themſelues finiſh.</p>
               <p>In their youthly beauties, thei procure many fauourers, who led by colours not ſubſtaunce, thinkes that the olde pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted face of <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> is the ſame it was when ſhe firſt became <hi>Plutos</hi> wife. Thei haue colours to be rubie tallowe faces, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to allaie groſe humours, Maſkes to couer deformed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:35"/> Periwigges to countenaunce their black buſhes, ſtrong buſkes to ſtraighten crooked bodies, greate Ruffes to abate their fulſome cheekes, ſmall Ruſfes to ſeeme bigge their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie faces, Frenche Vardingalles to ſet out and bolſter their bummes, high Pantoffles to make them to ſeeme tall, looſe Gaberdines to ſhadowe their wrong ſhapen bodies, ſtraight Gownes to ſet forth their proper proportions: Yea, ſuch ſweet ſoules bee theſe, as neither faſhion ſhall faile them that thei fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, nor pleaſure vnſought for that maie delight them.</p>
               <p>Theſe makes our youthes to bee diſſolute, not ſtudious: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, not venterous: wanton, not wiſe: curious, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant. In ſo muche that you maie ſee here as muche ryot, as in <hi>Rome</hi> ſuſpected Religion.</p>
               <p>This is the demeanure of the Court of <hi>Naples,</hi> this haue I ſeene and learned by myne owne experience. And for this <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> as thou ſaieſt thou art come to <hi>Naples,</hi> if to eſchewe by ſeeyng, and not to practiſe by beholding, I thinke no man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter welcome then my Countrey man, but if to followe that whiche I haue paſt ouer with repentaunce, no man ſoner wiſht from hence thence <hi>Simonides.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius Malius</hi> a formall Painter, yet hauyng deformed ſonnes, was partly touched at a Supper by a freend of his in this maner.</p>

                  <hi>Malius,</hi> thou painteſt well, but faſhioneſt ill, to whom the Painter aunſwered thus. Sir, I beget and faſhion children in the night, and neuer paint but by daie.</p>
               <p>As it fared with <hi>Malius</hi> in paintyng, ſo it falleth out with aduiſed men in their actions, for what thei enterpriſe, is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examined before it be put in proofe: yet what ſo by them is formed in ſilent, that is paſt their heades vnawares, theſe as framed in the darke, thei marre in the faſhion: but what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience perſwades thee too, paint that by daie, as a ſweete im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the ſoule: If ought ſodainly ouerſtippe thee by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, count it a baſtard thought and refuſe it, it came not of thy reaſon.

               <p>In the Citie of <hi>Scienna</hi> (a pleaſaunt &amp; commodious towne, renowned aſwell for the brauerie of the noble, as the wealth of the Marchaunt, and ſtored with greate foyſon of beautifull Damoſels) there dwelt a ſixe yeares agoe an honourable and renowned Magnifico called <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who hauyng large ſummes of money in moſt of our bankes of <hi>Jtaly;</hi> growne at laſt to the greateſt eſtimation in the Citie, and bleſt euery waie with the beſt ſupplies of fortune, was onely depriued of this comfort, that he was wiueleſſe: to the remedie whereof, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to caſt his eyes abroade, mindyng to fixe his fanſie on ſome faire yong damoſell, by whoſe companie in his declining yeares, he might perhappes be beautified with iſſue and heires to poſſeſſe his inheritaunce.

Wherevpon (after the Italian guiſe) he concluded with the father and freends, who more alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of his wealth then of his goodly perſonage, thei brought hym in the ende to the ſpeeche of the Daughter.</p>
               <p>She beyng yong, tender, faire, amiable, and full of all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeeyng her ſelf ſued too by ſuche an olde cruſt, began e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with a ſmilyng regarde to pretende what was to followe, and beyng curteouſly ſaluted by <hi>Sertorius,</hi> ſhe returned hym a requitall.

               <p>The yong Gentlewoman, hauyng heard her luſtie Woers ſuite, replied thus.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes <hi>Signior Sertorius,</hi> your yeares beyng almoſte growne to their date, you ſhould not be giuen to doate, and the heires of experience beautifiyng your head, you ſhould with good aduertiſement call your ſelf home.</p>
               <p>To ſhape an Oxe and an Aſſe in one Plough, were but a mockerie: to place hot and colde in one conſert, were as great follie: to ioyne age and youth in vowed Wedlocke, were very noyſome: how can there be agreement, where all thynges are contrary: or loue, where the parties be lothſome.</p>
               <p>Twere better to be buried honeſtly chaſt, then to be a Bride in an olde mans bed.</p>
               <p>One of your feete <hi>Signior Sertorius,</hi> is in the graue, the other declinyngly bendyng, can not brooke long to vpholde ſo croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a corſe.</p>
               <p>I in my prime of youth, natiue heate, cheefe beautie, like to maintaine combat againſt the fates a long tyme.</p>
               <p>You if perhappes (as I doubt me) you ſpeede of that you ſpeake for, when your ſmall heate is ſatiſfied, will tipe vp your heeles, and leaue poore <hi>Orienta,</hi> a ſorrowfull Widowe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mourned a little for maners ſake, findyng my ſelf vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered from ſuche a loathſome burthen, might diſporte my ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:16402:39"/> at my pleaſure, and make my ſelf bleſſed in my newe choyce.</p>
               <p>Noble Magnifico, thinke you of your Beades, not of your bed: of your Mattins, not of your Marriage: It is now tyme to finiſhe your accompt of pleaſure, ſince your principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formaunce is extinguiſhed. As for me, let me alone ſillie maide as I am, there be more fitter in <hi>Scienna</hi> for you to wed then my ſelf, and more meeter for me to match then with you.</p>
               <p>Thus deſiring <hi>Signior Sertorius</hi> to beare with <hi>Orientas</hi> rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhe takes her leaue mynded to followe her buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>This olde amorous Gentleman, hauyng bin galled ſo nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſcarce he could bridle his choler, yet yeeldyng to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe for the preſent, not doubtyng but in tyme the humour would ouerpaſſe, and that by her freendes perſwaſion, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris would bee pacified. This notwithſtandyng, he continued his wonted porte, feaſtyng the Father, flatteryng the Mother, preſentyng the Daughter, who delighted not in ſuche ſtale youthes, ſo that opertunitie (or the importunitie of the fates) ſerued, that to fruſtrate his enterpriſe, Loue began to wring the harte of a yong Gentleman, one of the ſame Citie, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng his paſſion no otherwiſe recurable, but by the fauour of <hi>Orienta,</hi> practiſed in what he might to compaſſe his purpoſe, towarde the attainement of her good grace, in ſo muche, that as occaſions were proffered, if <hi>Orienta</hi> would be holy, <hi>Fuluius</hi> would goe to Churche: if diſpoſed to walke for recreation, her ſuppliaunt muſt take the ayre.</p>
               <p>Thus preſentyng fire to the flaxe, the vncurable heate of the torment inflamed the yeeldyng affectes of the yong Damoſell to receiue the impreſſion, that being bothe touched with equall deſire, the yong man perplexed by reaſon of the matche the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretended with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> ſhe holding backe by maidenlike ſhamefaſtneſſe, becauſe ſhe was vnproffered, and bothe of them otherwiſe deteined then thei wiſht for. The noble courage of the yong Gentleman, led by a ſmilyng hope of heauenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde for a ſmall aduenture, compaſſyng in his cogitations many matters: At laſt he be thought hymſelf of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> whoſe wanton woyng was knowne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well through all <hi>Scienna,</hi> by hym onely in his mynd, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb facs="tcp:16402:39"/> the attainement of his purpoſe, though in deed his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemie in this attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuluius</hi> hauyng ſought hym out, with ſubtill information, he ſaluted hym thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Signior Sertorius,</hi> the olde familiaritie betweene my father and you, and the report of your curteous and honeſt dealynges in <hi>Scienna,</hi> hath made me (being forced thereunto by neceſſitie) to come and craue your fauour.</p>
               <p>Thus it is, that beyng greatly indebted in <hi>Scienna,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of continuall ſuites betweene the Houſe of the <hi>Coruaſij</hi> and me, for a certaine Caſtle betweene this and <hi>Aranthum,</hi> I am forced now by the Iudiciall decree, to buye their parte, and to this iſſue altogether vnfurniſhed of money, I am to ſell or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage certaine Reuenues, to the accompliſhing of my purpoſe. Wherevpon (good <hi>Signior</hi>) if either vpon morgage or ſale, it pleaſe you to furniſhe me with one thouſande Duckettes, I ſhall by this meanes, not onely be greatly bounde vnto you for your fauour, but alſo if in any ſeruice I maie ſtande in ſtead, preſt at your commaunde.</p>
               <p>The old Foxe though his lippes did water, diſſembling to loue no Grapes, aunſwered <hi>Fuluius</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>Good <hi>Fuluius,</hi> the nobilitie of the Houſe you come of, the faithfull freendſhip betweene your father and me, with the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and honourable behauiour of your ſelf, were ſufficient to inforce a ſtraunger, muche more a freend to pleaſure you. But when I looke into my preſent eſtate, and ſee the occaſions I haue to imploye my money, truely I am loth to ſet foote in the cauſe: notwithſtandyng, to pleaſure ſo honeſt a Gentleman as you, if you be mynded to ſell any Signorie, I will ſtraine my ſelf you ſhal haue money, <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſhal finde a frend of <hi>Sertorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman ſeemyng very deſirous, gaue our Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fico hartie thankes, aſſuryng hym that to the aduenture of his life, he would requite the fauour ſhewed him. Herevpon he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes price of a moſt pleaſaunt and beautifull Maner houſe with the demeanes, ſituate out of <hi>Scienna</hi> fiue or ſixe Leagues, the bargaine is beaten out and accordingly agreed vpon, that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi> ſhall haue the Fee ſimple of the Signorie of <hi>Brentio,

At this tyme <hi>Sertorius</hi> bethinkyng hymſelf of <hi>Brunellus</hi> with his faire <hi>Orienta,</hi> began to ſay thus in his owne imagination.</p>
               <p>Oh happie bargaine for me, this is a paſſyng preſent for my <hi>Orienta,</hi> I doubt not but if giftes will pleaſe the Goddes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes maie entice women: And on this he concluded in hym ſelf to delaie the liuerie and ſeaſon for one moneth, at whiche tyme, he beſought <hi>Fuluius</hi> to make honourable preparation for hym and his companie: addyng this moreouer, that the onely Gemme he deſired in the world, ſhould be there at the banquet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuluius</hi> perceiuyng how the game would goe, promiſed to performe what he required, and beyng aſſured by <hi>Sertorius</hi> to receiue his readie money he departed, and labouryng by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie meanes to come to the ſpeech of <hi>Orienta,</hi> he fel in acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce with an olde Gentlewoman, who had often recourſe to the houſe of <hi>Brunellus,</hi> and priuie familiaritie with <hi>Orienta,</hi> to whom <hi>Fuluius</hi> opened the bitter aſſaultes of his paſſion, and betwéene faire ſpeeches and liberall rewardes he ſo compaſſed this woman, that ſhe promiſed not onely to preferre his ſuite, but alſo to applie what perſwaſion ſhe thought neceſſarie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the attainement of the Maidens fauour.</p>

               <p>The occaſion (ſweete Miſtris) that you alowed me, is euen now happely atchiued, and he that was bolde to ſue in paper, is now here readie to performe in perſon, here is your loyall ſworne ſeruaunt <hi>Fuluius,</hi> who without your gracious aſpect, muſt finiſhe his life with vnmercifull martirdome.</p>
               <p>Here interrupted by the Muſitions, and hauyng traced on neatly the other <hi>Corranto, Orienta</hi> aunſwered.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo iniurious <hi>Signior Fuluius,</hi> but I will adde one benefite to hym that preferreth all occaſions: and if in chaſt loue, ſo good a Gentleman as you hath vowed your ſeruice, it maie be his chaunce to finde as conſtaunt a freend to yeeld him his rewarde.</p>
               <p>Here interrupted againe, at the third pauſe <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſpake thus.</p>
               <p>For benefites that ſhall paſſe from Beautie, <hi>Fuluius</hi> will be thankfull, and if it ſhall pleaſe <hi>Orienta,</hi> to fit all occaſions ſo well as ſhe framed this, <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſhall no doubt finde a remedie, and his Miſtris ſhall not repent her.</p>
               <p>Here the inſtaunt that interrupted the Louer, ſhortly ſerued the Ladie, who diſcourſed thus.</p>
               <p>My ſweete freend, if the Miſtris of thy harte, will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by my meanes, feare not, but ere long ſhe will make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time ſerue affection, or both ſatiſfie thy expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>Since the equall powers haue vouchſafed an vnitie betwene
<pb facs="tcp:16402:42"/> our affections (good Miſtris) I praie you let neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection bee wantyng to auoyde daunger, nor preuention bee ſought for to diſburden vs of all hinderaunce.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Scienna</hi> can well reporte of the loue <hi>Sertorius</hi> beareth you, of the importunate ſuites wherewith he ſoliciteth earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your father and you, and it may be for his exceeding wealth, he maie wipe the fatt from my fingers, vnleſſe pollicie preuent that whiche iniurious reſiſt hath proffered: ſo that now (good Miſtris) you muſt ſtande to your tacklyng, or els the Market is like to be marde.</p>
               <p>And lieth it in me ſweete freend (ſaid <hi>Orienta</hi>) to performe, truely then giue me inſtructions, and I wil quickly haue them without booke.</p>
               <p>Then gracious <hi>Orienta</hi> (ſaied <hi>Fuluius</hi>) thus it ſtandeth, I ſeeyng no meanes to attaine the diſcouery of myne affections towardes you, of late colourably went and compaſſed with the olde Magnifico your Woer, to ſell a peece of Lande, by that meanes thinkyng to wring out ſomewhat, by growyng in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie with hym, but the Foxe beyng wylie, ſet me beſide the Coſhin, yet greedily gapyng after my Reuenues, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to imploye twelue thouſand Crownes for a Manner of myne liyng ſixe Leagues from out this Citie, deſiryng me to make honourable prouiſion for his comming that day moneth, for that the ſweeteſt Gemme in the worlde ſhould be there with hym. I ſmellyng out his drift, breefly concluded on it, and by good fortune meetyng with courteous <hi>Eſperaunce,</hi> by whom this good happe hath been furniſhed, now hauyng taken coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of my ſeuen nightes pillow, if it ſhall pleaſe <hi>Orienta, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> at that ſeaſon ſhall be her maried pheare, and perhappes, make the Magnifico beſtowe a good childes parte on <hi>Orienta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The quicke wit of the yong Maiden, conceiuing at the firſt the conueiaunce of all, ſmilyngly thus interrupted hym.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuluius,</hi> I muſt take your tale before it fall, I ſmell out the drift of your pretence, to the furtheryng of whiche, <hi>Sertorius</hi> ſhall neither want faire promiſes, nor ſweete regardes: be thou as carefull in the reſt as I wil be in this, and the Gole is wun, the maiſterie is our owne.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:42"/>
               <p>Thus giuyng hym a gentle <hi>Baſele bouche,</hi> thei thruſt them ſelues amongſt the companie, where <hi>Orienta,</hi> to call away ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, ſaied thus.</p>
               <p>I had thought (Gentleman) that ſo many and ſundrie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, might haue been ſufficient to haue made you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but ſince I ſee you are ſo reſolute, you will admit no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, though you denaie vs the benefite of that, yet vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe vs the curteſie in this, that though you eate none of our Iunkettes, yet it will pleaſe you keepe ſome in ſtore for your freendes.</p>
               <p>It maie be (replied <hi>Fuluius</hi>) my humours be ſuch now (faire Damoſell) that if I ſhould diſcouer, I might barr my ſelf of a ſuppoſed benefite, but for theſe delicates, I had rather thei ſhould lye vneaten, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my fancie want to proſecute an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Why ſir (ſaid ſhe) looke about you, perhappes euen amongſt theſe Iunkettes, there will be founde ſomewhat to feede your humour.</p>
               <p>For Comfectes Miſtris (replied <hi>Fuluius</hi>) ſome bee coſtiue, and that fittes not my complexion: ſome comfortable to the ſtomacke, where I deſire quiet in mynde: all formde to pleaſe the ſence, where I deſire medicine to confirme the ſoule. So that ſeeyng there ſeemes no equalitie, neither in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither in my imagination, I thinke it better to let them lye for thoſe that liſt, for thei fit not the humour of them that Loue.</p>
               <p>In theſe diſcourſinges the night ouer paſt, and the tyme drewe on that the Bride would to bed, their Maſke therefore now readie to departe, <hi>Orienta,</hi> breefly tooke her leaue in this ſorte.</p>
               <p>Bee thou as carefull as thy freend will be conſtaunt, and as faithfull, as ſhe will be firme, and no doubt but good fortune in thyne owne houſe ſhall preſent thee with the greateſt pleaſure thou deſireſt, and ſo till then farewell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſatiſfied with theſe ſweete words, ſtraining her ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the finger ſaied thus.</p>
               <p>I beſeeche the iuſt heauens, ſo to further my proceedynges, as I am fed with thy delicacie, and ſo to haſten on the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment

               <p>The Mariage thus finiſhed, <hi>Brunellus</hi> with his faire daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accompanied with <hi>Sertorius</hi> drewe homewarde, and in the waie, who takes occaſion to court it but our Magnifico.</p>
               <p>Miſtris <hi>Orienta</hi> (ſaies he) how like you theſe ſportes that are paſt, were thei not pleaſaunt.

               <p>Well well (ſaied <hi>Orienta</hi>) it maie be if your fit holde till to morowe, I will ſtand ſo muche your freend as to be ſpeake you an <hi>Aſculapius,</hi> to lenifie your Feuer.</p>

                  <hi>Sertorius</hi> reuiued with her ſweete wordes, giuyng her har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thankes for her cordiall comforte, for that night tooke his leaue, deuiſing highly vpon the fauour, his Goddes had ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly graunted hym, and on the morowe beyng readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his houſe, <hi>Fuluius</hi> myndful of his buſineſſe, came to know his reſolution touchyng the former bargaine, <hi>Sertorius</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyng before the victorie, made <hi>Fuluius</hi> priuie to all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and in reſpect that he thought himſelf aſſured of <hi>Orienta</hi> for his wife, he was contented to beſtow that Patrimonie that then he was to take poſſeſſion of, vpon her, franckly and freely as a teſtimonie of his loue, deſiryng <hi>Fuluius</hi> the rather, with as muche honour as he might to receiue bothe hymſelf and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, not doubtyng but in the ende throughly to recompence ſuche fauour as he could or would beſtowe.</p>
               <p>

               <p>This onely ſuppoſe of your experience to ſubdue my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſweet <hi>Orienta</hi>) hath made this nightes ſleepe more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt then it would haue ben: and this mornyng ſo ſolitarie as I know I ſhould haue found it, ſo that comforted by your faire promiſe I deſire to bee confirmed in your fauour, and that no let nor hinderaunce may intercept our proceedynges, if you make ſtay for dower, thinkyng me more in loue with your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers then with your beautie, to eaſe you of that doubt, if it pleaſe you to take the aire for a daie or two in your fathes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, you ſhall ſee by euident proofe what prouiſo I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the matter: if for any thing els, that my ſilly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng can not conceiue, the leaſt rebuke you can vſe ſhould make a mendes, for <hi>Sertorius</hi> will onely bee addect to doe you ſeruice.</p>

               <p>As the Marble is at laſt with many droppes made to yeeld, the Iron by many fiers is made fluxible, the Tigreſſe by mans induſtrie made gentle, ſo my tender harte wone by the euident tokens of your goodwill beginns now to diſcouer thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes, whiche willyngly I would haue kept cloſe and in ſilent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſtraung regardes I haue beſtowed on you <hi>Signior Sertorius</hi>) was not in diſdaine, of your perſon but in tryall of your loialtie, if at your firſte repulſe you had giuen ouer, I ſhould by that meanes haue founde your lacke of loue, where now perſeueryng in your conſtauncy, I followe you, in breefe, <hi>Orienta</hi> is at your commaund in ſauegard of her honour, to accompany you where you pleaſe, and in honoſt Matrimonie, will be willyng to fulfill your deſires.</p>
               <p>The old Gentleman, findyng all thynges to ſort out ſo currantly on his ſide, runes to the Father, imbraceth the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p>The day long deſired by <hi>Fuluius,</hi> and as often wiſht for by <hi>Orienta</hi> is come, our Magnifico with his ſuppoſed Father and Mother in law with his ſweet Miſtris are mounted, and aprochyng nere to <hi>Fuluius</hi> Caſtell (who attended their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) he thus entertained <hi>Signiori</hi> and <hi>mes Dames,</hi> you are al hartely welcome, you <hi>Singnior Sertoruis,</hi> to receiue the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your owne, theſe to be pertakers of ſuch pleaſures as at this inſtant I can aquaint them withall, as the perſon whom I moſt honour in <hi>Scienna,</hi> wherefore if it ſhal pleaſe you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you ſhall trie that in deed whiche I report in promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thei yelding him very courtious thankes, but eſpecially <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienta</hi> zelouſly honouring his humanitie, with ſoft ſpeeches vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>The powers I thinke in thy affabilitie, hath concluded ſuch force, as maugre all effectes the braueſt muſt bowe: this ſaied, thei altogether entered. It were in vaine to recount the bountie of their repaſt, the ſeemelineſſe of their Lodgynges, the varietie of their pleaſures, for theſe would but ſet Seafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng mens lippes on water, let vs but looke into the ſucceſſe to make vs merrie.</p>
               <p>Truely Gentleman ſo it was, that the firſt night ouer paſt, <hi>Sertorius</hi> willyng to conclude what he had in mynde, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Brunellus</hi> his wife and daughter, began thus to breake with them.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the bountie of your ſweete Daughter (good <hi>Brunellus</hi>) who ſettyng aſide all nicetie and coyneſſe, hath at the laſt vouchſafed me her fauour, to the ende I maie in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng make euident my zealous good will, I will at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt, franckly and freely imparte that vnto her, which by the payment of twelue thouſand Crownes I am to enioye: then callyng vnto hym a Notarie, whom for that purpoſe he had brought thether with hym, he made a faithfull conueiaunce to <hi>Orienta,</hi> of the whole Purchace, in as full title and proportion,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:44"/> as he bought it of <hi>Fuluius,</hi> and in preſence paiyng the readie money, he cauſed the liuerie and ſeaſon, with all coueyauntes, conueiaunces, ſpecialities what ſo euer (in the preſence of the whole companie) to be deliuered to <hi>Orienta,</hi> who baſhfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng them, ſpake thus to <hi>Sertorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe not beſtow my fancie for peney fauour (liberall Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifico) but for loue, neither meane I by giftes to be tied to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, it maie therefore pleaſe you with my fauour to receiue them againe as my gift, for what in loue ſhal paſſe from me, ſhall be bound to no conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sertorius</hi> altogither inflamed with her courtious and wiſe demeanour, began to proteſt before the aſſemblie, that without reſpect of any thing what ſo euer he beſtowed the benifite, who vouchſafed very well, to imploye ſo ſmall a purchace on her, who was the onely continuer of his decaiyng life.</p>
               <p>The freendes of <hi>Orienta</hi> ſeyng his noble and liberall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thanked him highly, eche one praiſed his bountie, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Fuluius</hi> whom it beſt behoued, who ſeyng now that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunities did haſten on his happineſſe, all that daie plied his gueſtes with bountifull cheare and ſtore of good wines. Night drawyng on, thei were by their retinue conuaied to their Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynges, <hi>Orienta,</hi> deſirous to ſee the iſſue of her delightes, and beyng altogether impacient of delaies, whiſperyng <hi>Fuluius</hi> in his eare ſhe ſpake thus.</p>

               <p>Thou olde <hi>Palliard,</hi> it is neither thy painted ſpeeches ſhall diſwade, nor thy faire gloſes maie deminiſhe the furie of myne yre, who like a ſubtil wetch, haſt rauiſhed me of my onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and brought me hether to the abandonyng of myne owne Daughter, is this the loue that with ſolemne vowes and open proteſtations thou waſt wont to make, is this thy loiall freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, be theſe the fruites of thy liberalitie. O that I had buried my poore <hi>Orienta,</hi> or preſerued her from a Lecherous bed, but this wrong ſhall be reuenged.</p>
               <p>And now and then in this diſcourſing, he entermedled his ſpeeches with a buffet, he on the one ſide, his wife on the other ſide fliyng with her nailes to the face of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> the noyſe whereof brought in the aſſiſtauntes of <hi>Fuluius,</hi> who laughyng merily at this mad conceipt, after thei had firſt parted the fraie, thei began to queſtion with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> what might be the cauſe of this broyle, who poore man, altogether ignorant of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, exclaimed thus.</p>
               <p>Vnhappie man that I am, who in myne olde yeares, and in the tyme I looked for reſt, ſhould bee thus afflicted with ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.

With this, interrupted by the forſeu of his teares, he fell doune dead with very greefe of mynde.

               <p>This ſedull ouer read by one of the cheefeſt Magiſtrates of the Citie, the whole aſſemblie continued mute along ſpace, in the ende, an auncient Philoſopher (as he ſeemed) beſpake him thus.</p>
               <p>Vnſearchable (O ye <hi>Athenians</hi>) is the power of the Godes, by whoſe benefites, ſince this Towne hath been a long tyme maintained, yet ceaſe thei not by their euerlaſtyng wiſdomes, to continue it, to whoſe beneficence, if we compare our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, we ſhall iuſtly conclude, that the Godes created vs to many vertues, and wee haue bound our ſelues bondſlaues to monſtrous vices: If therefore we looke into our owne ſtates, and compare our aunciters good, with our ill, we ſhal confirme <hi>Licurgus</hi> dead teſtimonie, and pointyng to our beſt <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers, we ſhall touch this one with the blot of auerice, and note that other with the blemiſhe of vaine glorie.</p>
               <p>If by the hidden workyng of the Godes we are put in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of our eſcapes, let vs mend them. And ſince with more fauour then to other Cities, thei haue bleſſed vs with more circomſpection, in reuerence of their bountie let vs become more circomſpecte.</p>
               <p>This ſcedull preſenteth vnto our Prince pollicie: to our
<pb facs="tcp:16402:52"/> Religious ſanctimonie: to our Layetie continency. By exceſſe onely we are found to haue falne, hauing gathered in ſo many yeres ouer paſſed, many errors, recouered no vertues. Oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie <hi>Athens,</hi> when <hi>Agis</hi> not reſpectyng the furie of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte nor Kyng, began to pull downe the pride of <hi>Athens.</hi> Oh vnfortunate Citie when by the diligence of <hi>Pericles,</hi> Golde brought pride into <hi>Athens.</hi> We ſtand amaſed now confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our ſelues by our ſeldome aſſpectes, impartyng the gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of our conciences, neither hauyng that confirmitie of mynd in vs that befitteth Philoſophers, nor that valewe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as in the daies of the Law maker <hi>Licurgus</hi> we once had. If we will be wiſe, why are our attemptes ſauced with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce: if learned, why are we blind in diſcipline. If we reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ſelues of our former eſtates, how we haue been glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our well doyng, contemned in our ill, how accounted of for our expeditions, how diſdained for our flatteries, we ſhal find all our goodes to procede from good counſaile, as our bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from contempt of the Godes.</p>
               <p>So that now thus it ſtandeth, ſince the floudes, the fates, yea the <hi>Fliſian</hi> feildes are ſo fauourable, that the one caſteth vp, the other bleſſeth, the laſt greeteth vs with heauenly documen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and neceſſary forewarninges, let the head rule the feet, eche member folow the ſuperior, all conclud in a mediocritie, and not only leaue thoſe memories ingrafted in table of record, but alſo imprinte them in our hartes, to the ſatiſfaction whereof, O you <hi>Athenian</hi> Senators, I coniure you to applie all your ſtudies.</p>
               <p>The graue old father hauing thus finiſhed his oration, ech alowed his counſaile, and the Magiſtrates of the Citie hauing accordyng to the direction of the ſedull, redeliuered the coffin vnto the flouds, with many ſolemne cerimonies performed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Neptune,</hi> thei vppon aduiſed deliberation, did commit the ſcrole vnto the common treaſure, as an euerlaſtyng and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable miracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuphues</hi> and <hi>Simonides</hi> beholdyng all theſe thinges with incredible admiration, departed towarde their lodgyng, where after thei had a while reſted themſelues, <hi>Euphues</hi> brake of their
<pb facs="tcp:16402:52"/> vnneceſſary ſilence thus.</p>
               <p>It is neither occaſion (noble Spaniard) that preferreth, nor pollicie whiche procureth but the Godes whiche fauour theſe actions.</p>
               <p>Thou art come to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſee but blind guides, yea, blind are we in coulers that ſhould know all proportions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fredericke</hi> my freende, hath preſented thee with a flower without ſent, with a bare ſhadow ond no ſubſtance, with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous towne in name, but bad in nature. So that vnleſſe thou canſte make of venemous confections, holſome Triacles, of poyſonable <hi>Mummi</hi> comfortable <hi>Methridat,</hi> in ſeekyng here for <hi>Sibill</hi> thou ſhalt encounter a <hi>Siren,</hi> and for the image of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandre</hi> the protrature of <hi>Jrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue ſeen much <hi>(Simonides)</hi> and marked ſomewhat, yet in <hi>Athens</hi> neuer knew I more fooles leſſe Philoſophers. The Roſe ſauoreth ſweetly yet hath his prickell, <hi>Mercurie</hi> is ſnow white yet deadly poiſon, the Peacocke faire plumed yet black footed, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſweete tonged yet ill manired.</p>
               <p>If as <hi>Demoſtines</hi> trauiled to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to inioy <hi>Layes, Simonides</hi> be come to <hi>Athens</hi> to learne faſhions, as the Philoſopher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be lauiſhe for a little pleaſure, <hi>Simonides</hi> will bee as curious to imitat ſo vaine preſidentes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> it fareth now, as in <hi>Rome</hi> it did once, here plenty maketh vs proud, their high honours made them haughtei.</p>
               <p>As theſe errours I note are incident to theſe Cities, ſo are the vertues the nominated in ſedull, practiſed farre of from this Citie, which when better opportunitie ſerueth, I will not onely vtter to thy pleaſure, but alſo open to thy profite. Meane tyme, if it pleaſe thee to take parte of a Scholers repaſt, thou ſhalt haue the benefite perhappes of a morrall diſcourſe, which may make recompence for the ſlenderneſſe of thy diet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides,</hi> comparyng all <hi>Euphues</hi> curteſies together, knit vp his aunſwer in this forme.</p>
               <p>The benefite that is reapt by good counſaile (gentle <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phues</hi>) as it profiteth him that by experience vttereth, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it the other who as yet was ignorant.</p>
               <p>So fareth it with me, that hearyng thoſe ſage preceptes
<pb facs="tcp:16402:53"/> that paſſe from thee: I am not onely perſwaded of the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie of thy wiſdome, but alſo inured to the imitation of thy vertues. Many caſualties happen, whiche although thei be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vniuarſallie, yet confirme they ſome one perticuler more then the reſt, and I thinke that theſe caſualties as now hath happened in <hi>Athens,</hi> when as ſuch a one at the inſtante is reſident, who with eloquence may blazen out the myracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe of the accident, and by good admonition ſubdue the errours of this Citie.</p>
               <p>As I came to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſee it, ſo ſailed I hether to here thee, and though the delight of the one bee ſomewhat aunſwerable to my trauell, yet thy eloquence is that whiche onely excedeth the report.</p>
               <p>For this Citie, I find it more faughtie then famous, for thee, more learned then I haue yet hard ſpoken.</p>
               <p>As for the noueltie that latly happined, if ſo the ſtate be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any where as there it is ſet downe, I doubt not but peace hath there ſeated her ſelf in ſecuritie, &amp; that either the Climate is ſo gratious that all are wiſe from their cradell, and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate by the benifit of the place. For thy repaſt, I accept it: for thy morrall diſcourſe I wiſhe for it, and deſire in as ſhorte ſpace I might be made copartner of thy conformitie, as I ſhall with thankfull harte bee pertaker of thy diet. This ſaied, thei ſat downe, and hauyng ſatiſfied them ſelues with ſuche proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as then was prepared for them, <hi>Euphues</hi> at length began thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides,</hi> though the courſeneſſe of thy diet bee not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bountie of the court, yet here amongſt vs ſtudents, we rather eſteme of a <hi>Socraticum conuiuium,</hi> than the exceſſiue dainties of the banquets of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> thinking that no more than neceſſary repaſt is requiſite for the profeſſors of ſciences, eſpecially to ſatiſfie nature, whereas in reſpecte of the ſoule it can not be ſufficiently confirmed with the ſweete preceptes of philoſophie.</p>
               <p>Truely ꝙ <hi>Simonides</hi> (interrupting <hi>Euphues,</hi>) ſuche as the complections of the bodie and the diſpoſition of the ſoule is, ſuch eſteeme I the externall actions, and the internal delight,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:53"/> as for this meale we haue made, wee haue I confeſſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſerued our appetites, but for the ſoule, it hathe ſundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and what one likes, another loathes.</p>
               <p>Truth it is, ſaide <hi>Euphues,</hi> that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> delighteth her ſelfe in daliance, where <hi>Diana</hi> alonely aloweth chaſtitie, <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſoliciteth him ſelfe in laughter, but wiſe <hi>Cato</hi> in grauitie and ſadneſſe: eche nature as it is diſpoſed fo worketh it, which maketh apparance euen nowe in my ſelfe, who tho whilome I liked loue, nowe loath I luſte, though once I counted <hi>Cupid</hi> for a God, nowe I account vaine loue godleſſe.</p>
               <p>But it may be <hi>Simonides</hi> in this my nature, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution we diſagree, you fire, I froſt, you amorous, I ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which if it be ſo, I doubt not but to ſitte ſuch occaſions, as touching that moſt neareſt which hitteth you moſt feately, I may in this imitate <hi>Phirne</hi> the harlot, who beeing preſented by <hi>Praxetiles</hi> the Painter with that picture which ſoeuer that beſt wiihin his whole ſtorie ſhoulde pleaſe hir fantaſie, ſhe very carefull to make a warie choice of ſo pleaſaunt a giſte, cauſed one ſodainely to informe the Painter that hys ſhoppe was on fire, who amongſt the reſt of his tables, demaunding if the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Cupid</hi> was vnuiolated, was cunningly compaſſed by <hi>Phirne</hi> in this, who ſatiſfied hir expectation by the opinion of tye workemaiſter himſelfe. So ſhall <hi>Euphues</hi> in ſearching out of diſpoſitions worke wyth <hi>Simonides,</hi> if thou giue me but an inckling, I wil take an Item, if thou bewray by a wincke, I will compaſſe by a wyle, and hauing the reine in hande re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine thy affection, and knowing the ſize of thy foote, fit thee wyth a pantofie.</p>

               <p>As <hi>Charilaus</hi> to his countrymen, ſo <hi>Fuphues</hi> to <hi>Simonides,</hi> if thou wilt be accounted fruitfull in trauell, be not lauiſhe in affection, if a man led by reaſon, eſchew laſciuiouſneſſe, if loue be vnprofitable perſeuer not.</p>
               <p>Euerie chaſte eye iudgeth not by coulors, and euerie wyſe affection paſſeth not by likelihoodes, and when as I promiſed thee a morall diſcourſe to amend thy fare, it ſhall bee no other than a cooling carde to alay thy fancie: <hi>Simonides</hi> interrupte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting hys attempted purpoſe ſayde thus: O <hi>Euphues,</hi> beware leaſt in bewraying my errours, thou open thine owne eſcapes, I confeſſe thou haſte touched mine opinions, and yet perhaps canſt hardly perſwade by thy propoſitions.</p>
               <p>An inueterate euil hauing taken deepe roote is hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted from hys holdfaſt: I haue ſene ſeuerall cities, gathered many experiences, forſaken ſundrie opinions, but in that only which thou wouldeſt reprooue, I haue perſeuered moſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and herein do I diſtinguiſh my loue from lightneſſe, for vaine, affection, makyng but a light impreſſion, is ſoone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed where the loue I beare to my <hi>Clarinda</hi> of <hi>Ciuil,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a firſt ſights fancie, neyther can be extinguiſhed before my laſt minutes ſighing.</p>
               <p>But for that <hi>Euphues</hi> hath attempted to diſſwade, <hi>Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> will be attentiue to heare, and if there growe a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis by Athenian perſwaſion, it may be I will returne my fancies agayne to my countrey <hi>Ciuil.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Fuphues</hi> pauſing a while of thefe ſpeaches at the laſt brake into theſe tearmes.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Zopirus</hi> the Perſian for the loue of <hi>Darius,</hi> ſo <hi>Euphues</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> for the loue of <hi>Simondes:</hi> hee ſpared not to deforme
<pb facs="tcp:16402:54"/> hys members to ſubdue the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> I not to diſcloſe mine errours to confirme thy vnſteadineſſe.</p>
               <p>In my prime youth I was amarous in <hi>Naples,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnfortunate, I loued <hi>Lucilla,</hi> and therefore vnluckie, my ſerious ſeruices were requited wyth light miſlikes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vainely attempted, my confirmitie grewe by experience, and herein was I happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides</hi> is now he whome <hi>Euphues</hi> was once, he loueth, but whome, a woman, and ſhe ſliding, he ſerueth, what ſaint, <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and is he ſure ſhee is conſtant?</p>
               <p>I feare me vnleſſe <hi>Tirpandrus</hi> lenifie by Muſicke, <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnestra</hi> wyll not be chaſte, and tho our Spaniard bydes tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for hys Maiſtreſſe, yet may it be doubted that ſhe vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth a minion.</p>
               <p>Euery cleare morrow maketh not a fayre day, neyther e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſwalow a ſommer, al hooke noſed men are not Ciceroes, nor euerie blemiſhed face y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Image of <hi>Alexander,</hi> euery beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull is not vertuous, ne euerie ſweete face of ſounde behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: <hi>Helena</hi> cornuted <hi>Menelaus,</hi> yet was ſhe comely, <hi>Dalida</hi> bewrayed, <hi>Sampſon,</hi> yet was ſhe louely.</p>
               <p>Eche ſweete ſhape is not perfite, a ſtaine wil bee ſeene on the picture of <hi>

               <p>O <hi>Simonides,</hi> when I compare mine houres ſtudying to my dayes louing, I finde no one attempt in loue ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, that mine houres reading confirmes not to be corrupte.</p>
               <p>Truely, as the teares of the heart are bitter, ſo are the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in loue baleſome, as the teares of the boare are ſwete, ſo are the refrainings from beautie moſte neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Alas ſweete friende, little wotteſt thou the venome the ſerpent couereth vnder ſweete ſhadowes, the poyſon ſhee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth vnder pleaſaunt aſpectes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Zeno Citicus</hi> beholding a prowde preciſe felow paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:16402:55"/> a quagmire, verie daintely reprooued his errour thus, hee doth worthily ſuſpecte the quagmire, in that he cannot beholde his proportion in it as in a glaſſe, women in their owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in aught that ſuſpitiouſly toucheth their honours, paſſe it ouer ſlightly, and by this meanes vnto the wiſe bewray their vanity, who demying with their daintineſſe to dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in anet, are by the circumſpecte founde guiltie of thoſe errours, which by their mincing ouerſlips they would haue pretermitted.</p>
               <p>I neuer ſawe in beautie that which was not ſauced wyth ſoure, in loue, that which ſauoured not of follie, in blinde affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that which was not repented wyth many hearte-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>The pompous glorie of the worlde maye intice, for they beare a ſhewe hf continuance, promotions may perſwade for why they are the benefites of good fortune.</p>
               <p>Loue may neuer by any aſſumptions allure, when as neither the bodie is affected with certaine honor, nor the ſoule recompenced wyth the leaſt perfection whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Wyth like happineſſe poſſeſſe louers their Maiſtreſſes, as <hi>

               <p>In loue what ſeeth the eie, laſciuiouſneſſe, what heareth the eare, laſciuiouſneſſe, what vttereth the tongue, laſciuiouſnes, what thinketh the hart, laſciuiouſneſſe, what inureth the body, laſciuiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Truely <hi>Simonides,</hi> the follie of affection is wonderfull, yet are the errours of beautie more admirable, when as in her ſelfe ſhe is but a painted ſepulchre, and in her actions, the demini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of all naturall and morall reaſon.</p>
               <p>What neede I repeate former examples, to confirme later attempts? O <hi>Simonides,</hi> I had a friend, who now beyng ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from me, abideth in a delectable Iland wyth the Miſtris of his pleaſures, in whoſe loue I founde warre, and ſtraighte truce, nowe truce, and then warre, as the Comedian ſaith: ye when the agony of loue gouerned his proceedings, neyther
<pb facs="tcp:16402:55"/> was the league of friendſhip accompted of, nor ſerious perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions alowed of.</p>
               <p>I haue heard of many that were madde for loue, yet neuer heard I of anie that were wiſe in loue, I haue read of conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that by loue haue become eſfeminate, I neuer founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (though neuer ſo great a Monarch, that was not ſeduced by loue, I haue known the wiſe haue bene beſotted by fancie, yet neuer knew I fancie that made a wiſe man.</p>
               <p>If as the Camelion by the aire men liue by loue, as the beſt is in a moment tranſformed to as manie coloures as it behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſo is the louer afflicted wyth as manie cogitations as hee imagineth of, now happie, ſtraight hapleſſe, nowe fortunate, ſtraight frowarde, now bleſſed, ſtraight curſed.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Simonides,</hi> ſince thou ſeeſt the ſoure, chooſe the ſwete, admit perſwaſion as a <hi>Cullice</hi> to comfort, or a ſword to deſtroy as an <hi>Antidotum</hi> to confirme, or an <hi>Aconitum</hi> to confound.</p>
               <p>Refuſe loue for it will harme thee, the greene graſſe ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the blacke ſerpent, the painted pot the deuouring poyſon, the faire woman the wanton minde? hathe thy Maiſtreſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed thee, then arte thou happie, for, if her fortune were to prooue laſciuious, then how bleſſed art thou to looſe her, if too wiſe, ſhe woulde be too buſie, if fooliſh, ſhe woulde be too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome: ſo that he might bee counted to bee ouer franticke, that for a bed pleaſure, woulde bee troubled with the nurſing of ſo vnweldie a babe.</p>
               <p>If men woulde diſpoſe their eyes as warily, as women diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playe their beauties, gariſhly they ſhoulde borrow birdlime from the fouler. and binde the birder by compaſſe in his owne briars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atatus Pbilometor,</hi> was wonte in his princely gardens, to ſet <hi>Aconitum,</hi> and to weede out the bleſſed thiſtle, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the prompteſt and readieſt wittes that be, ingraffe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and diſpoſſeſſe vertues. As if <hi>Euripides</hi> from laughter, <hi>Simonides</hi> coulde refraine from loue, the Poet ſhoulde not ſo much be recommended for his tragedies, as <hi>Simonides</hi> for hys vertues.</p>
               <p>If men were as throughly armed wyth perſwaſions as
<pb facs="tcp:16402:56"/> 
                  <hi>Dioniſius</hi> wyth bad clothing, they would aſwell ſcape the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of fancie, as the tyrant the furie of the ſouldiour.</p>
               <p>But for that night calleth awaie, and thy drowping eies perſwade me thou wouldeſt be a ſleepe, <hi>Simonides,</hi> let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that ſince loue is vnneceſſarie, thou refuſe it, and ſince the pleaſure is not permanent, builde not thou thy opinions on it, and ſince I perſwade with reaſon perſeuer thou not in error, ſo ſhalte thou thincke thy trauaile wel imployed to <hi>Athens,</hi> and thy returne ſhall be more fortunate to <hi>Ciuil. Simonides</hi> wyth hys eyes full of ſleepe, began dreamingly to determine thus.</p>
               <p>Although thy eloquence ſhoulde make me <hi>Argus,</hi> yet the matter thou talkeſt of inforctth mee to bee <hi>Endemon,</hi> what is ſubdued in thee, is rooted in mee, ſo that, thoughe perſwaſion may confirme for a while, yet if fancie doe but a little kindle the coales, we ſhal ſoone haue fire: but for that night calleth on, and I deſire to be more readie to morrowe, to heare the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of thy promiſe touching the Iland thou talkeſt of, I beſeech thee let vs vſe the aduice of our pillows, whether this nights diſcourſe be auaileable.</p>
               <p>And doe <hi>Simonides</hi> (ꝙ <hi>Euphues</hi>) ſo perchaunce at Sunne riſing, thou wilt either repent thee of a folly, or remember thée of a good leſſon.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, <hi>Euphues</hi> conueied <hi>Simonides</hi> to his Lodging, and after betooke hymſelf to his owne couch, where repoſing them ſelues a conuenient ſpace, at laſt the meſſenger of the Sunne with pleaſaunt redneſſe be coloured <hi>Euphues</hi> face: who beeyng very ſtudious betooke hymſelf to his bookes: And after ſome deliberation, thinking it good time to goe viſite his new gueſt, he came vnto hym whom he founde readie, and after a gentle <hi>Bon ioure</hi> paſt betwene them, thei determined to take the aire: And walkyng out into a pleaſaunt Groue, hauyng a goodly proſpect into both Sea and Champion: for it was eminent, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> began thus.</p>
               <p>Feeend <hi>Euphues,</hi> beholdyng now the waue, whiche preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Athens</hi> yeſterdaie with <hi>Licurgus</hi> good counſaile, I am brought in memorie of a certaine report of yours, wherein you
<pb facs="tcp:16402:56"/> ſpecified an Ilande, whereas thoſe documentes were practiſed whiche the ſedull preſented, maie it pleaſe you now, from your bitter inuectiues againſt Loue, to fall to your worthie declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Ilande, wherevpon perhappes I maie be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that hauyng paſt ouer a greate parte of the worlde co ſee faſhions, I maie make a fewe monethes ſaile thether to learne vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euphues</hi> hauyng pauſed a little ſpace, in the ende brake out into theſe ſpeaches.</p>
               <p>Truely <hi>Simonides,</hi> thou at this inſtaunt perſwadeſt me to the remembrauece of that in whiche once, hauyng placed my cheefeſt felicitie, I now am almoſt rauiſhed with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce onely of the place.</p>
               <p>Thou deſireſt a report of that noble Spanyard, which with out wonder I did not ſee, nor without pleaſure thou canſt not heare.</p>
               <p>And herevpon I can not imagine, whether with more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I maie ſpeake of the ſituation of the place, or the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the people, the one is ſo worthely fenced by nature, the other ſo noblie nurtured by vertue.</p>
               <p>For the Ilande it ſelf, in olde tyme it hath been called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion,</hi> and after by the ariuall of the <hi>Troyan</hi> Trauailer <hi>Brutus,</hi> it was called <hi>Britanie,</hi> afterwarde brought vnder the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Engustus,</hi> it was called <hi>Enguſtland,</hi> and dy ſucceſſion as now continueth the name of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gouernours hereof by their manifolde vertues, haue not onely filled <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo repleniſhed <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Climate very beneficial for prouiſion to maintaine a State, neither wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng Wooll for clothyng, nor Corne and Cattle for foode: So that if any one Countrey in the worlde bee bleſſed with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, I thinke this Iland happie, beyng fenced by the <hi>Occean</hi> againſt forraine Inuaſions, and gouerned by good lawes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde populer Mutinies.</p>
               <p>The Princes haue euer been ruled by diſcrete gouernours, thei haue conquered and ſubdued many Nations, the <hi>Jriſhe</hi> are vnder their ſubiection, from the French by Conqueſt thei bare a title: yea, ſo happie this Nation is, as in their peace all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:16402:57"/> wonder, and in their fauour eche Countrey glorieth.</p>
               <p>So that it can hardly be ſaied, whether thei bee more feared for their power, or honoured for their proweſſe. Generally, thei are all valiaunt not fearyng Warlike attemptes, but with as greate wiſedome preuent, as with valewe thei performe.</p>
               <p>Of perſonage thei are ſeemely, of behauiour comely, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell coſtly, in entertainyng ſtraungers none more readie: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious thei be without hipocriſie: ſerious in preferryng their Countrey: to their fréendes Lambes: to their enemies Lyons.</p>
               <p>The men beyng thus, what more to bee wondered at then their women: Beautie in them hath beſtowed her ſweeteſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: Nature hath benefited them with all ſeemely proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Art finiſhed them with ſcience and affabilitie.</p>
               <p>They are ſweete in behauiour, without lightneſſe, ſtedfaſte in louing, yet not laſciuious, conſtant in religion, not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, braue in attire, yet are not proude.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Simonides,</hi> countrey, lawes, men, women of all ſorts are thus good by nature, and of this behauiour through wiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: now ſeeing al theſe perfections do thus concurre in one, of what exquiſiteneſſe ſhoulde the prince be, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes are ſo perfect.</p>
               <p>Truely the Engliſhe regiment (to eche mans admiration <hi>Simonides</hi>) at this day is ſo gouerned, as neither <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Iurie</hi> for iuſtice, nor <hi>Alfonſus</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> for affabilitie, nor <hi>

               <p>She, as report runneth, theſe xxv. yeares hath ſo gouerned her dominions, as neyther conſpiracie coulde either eſcape the circumſpection of the gouerner, nor mercie bee pretermitted, if ſubmiſſion were preferred: This bleſſed Princeſſe <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> hath now dominion ouer this bountifull Ilande, whoſe

               <p>I haue read of many, that for their wiſedome, excellencie, and other their vertues were worthy of ſouerainty, yet neither <hi>Helerna,</hi> for wiſedome, nor <hi>Zoe</hi> for policie maye matche hir: <hi>Hermodica</hi> ſhe is for hir proportion, <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> for her knowlege in philoſophie, fitter to gouerne a kingdome than <hi>Zenobia,</hi> &amp; meeter than <hi>Arete</hi> to teache <hi>Aristippus,</hi> for chaſtitie ſhee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <hi>Adeſia,</hi> for eloquence <hi>Cornelia,</hi> for religion <hi>Fabiola,</hi> my tongue faileth me to declare, not her vertues, to ſupplie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: her princely maieſtie is mixed with natural clemencie as the roſe amiddeſt the brambles, ſo her vertues amongeſt many women, I muſt wyth <hi>Politianus</hi> as of his <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> ſo of this <hi>Elizabeth</hi> end thus:

               </p>
               <p>For her counſaile they are ſage, prudent in all things, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in nothing, for their lawes, they haue relation, firſte to religion, next to determination, thirdly, preſcription and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, they auow titles, al courts whatſoeuer, and pleas what ſo they be hauing paſte the afperite of the lawe, may yet be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by conſcience, ſo that if aught be neglected by errour in pleading, may be relieued by equitie of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Their miniſterie is ruled by diſcreete paſtors, their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers reprehende ſinne liberally, the common ſorte zealouſly amende, great is the loue of the ſubiect towards their Prince, hartie the loue of the prince towards the ſubiect: but who that but looketh into the Princes court, ſhall finde, not onely cauſe to praiſe, but to wonder. The Nobilitie be ſo valiant, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo continent, their traines ſo well ordered: beautiful may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens be there yet not too amorous, bountiful Nobles be there
<pb facs="tcp:16402:58"/> yet not too prodigall: all courtlike actions are ſo ſauced with diſcretion, as neither exceſſe make aught to be miſliked of, nor niggardlineſſe cauſe any thing to be exclaimed on.</p>
               <p>Truth it is, <hi>Elizabeths</hi> mantion is an <hi>Academie,</hi> no court where men are ſo eloquent, women ſo prudent, al ſo continent.</p>
               <p>There is not the pompe of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> yet is the ſtate magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, there is not the traine of <hi>Darius,</hi> yet ſuche are they there, as be gallant: the end is, the Engliſh court excelleth all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces palaces for vertues, and matcheth them for vnſtained glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for the practiſe of morall precepts what countrie ſo fortu-tunate, as equitie ruleth at home, ſo iniuries are not preferred abroade: yea, but looke into one yeares action there, and it wil folow, that whatſoeuer <hi>Licurgus</hi> left here in paper, thou maieſt beholde there in practiſe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16402:60"/> mate, eche tooke them ſelues to their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Onely one amongſt the reſt, who by his Habite ſeemed to be ſome Philoſopher, ſtood ſtill ſometyme beholdyng the <hi>Welkin,</hi> other ſometyme he would looke downe to the Waue.

               <p>Sir, if it ſhall ſtand with your liking, to make a poore Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailer partaker of your ſtudies, you maie in ſo doyng bothe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie your ſelf, and alſo pleaſure me, for that I muche deſire to looke in Sciences.</p>
               <p>Truely aunſwered <hi>Phileſius</hi> (for ſo the Philoſophers name was called) I am ſilent more then I would be (good ſir) in that perhappes ſome here (as the moſt parte of the world) diſdaine Artes, accomptyng the profeſſors thereof to be either fooliſhe or franticke. Wherevpon, I thought it more meete to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate in ſilence, then to be contemned for my Philoſophie.</p>
               <p>What other mens diſpoſitions are I knowe not (quoth <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>) but for my ſelfe, I not onely delight in Science, but alſo deſire to knowe it, pleaſe it you therefore (the rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge our trauaile) to varie on ſome propoſition, whereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome hidden ſecretes of Nature maie be opened, or ſome celeſtiall working of the ſuperiour heauens in theſe inferiour creatures may be denotated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phileſius,</hi> as willing to performe as <hi>Simonides</hi> to require, ſaide thus: Gentle ſir, my preſent muſing at this time, is not to be included in fewe tearmes, neither may a reaſonable vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume comprehend my imaginations, for why, the ſoule paſſeth through more in a moment, than in many yeares may be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſet downe.</p>
               <p>Whilome I was comparing the worlde, which is ſpherical and rounde (which of all proportions is the beſte) nexte of the gouernement of ſo myraculous a firmament: thirdly, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration the ſuperior powers haue in theſe inferiour ſubiectes: fourthly, what affinitie may be betweene Arte and Nature: fiftly, howe Arte came firſt to light, and was continued by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p>Al theſe propoſitions haue I compared in thought, and now
<pb facs="tcp:16402:61"/> orderly will I ſpeake of them for your pleaſure.</p>
               <p>For the worlde (accordyng to the forme) what is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, whoſe orderly reuolutions, diſtinguiſhing tymes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing euentes to euery caſualtie, giue occaſion (to a conſiderat iudgement) to wonder at the motion, and reuerence the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: the beautie whereof is ſuche, as in old time it hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been diefied for the glorie it poſſeſſed, but alſo accompted of by ſome of no ſmall iudgement in Philoſophie for a GOD: which reaſon contemned of thoſe of ſome iudgement in that it was created, cauſeth that more honour is atributed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter then the worke.</p>
               <p>But for the opinion of the Philoſophers touchyng this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, truely wee of late iudgement, and growne more nerer to the knowledge of God, reproue all for paſſed poſitions as fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous, and confirme with <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> that God onely is wiſe: Men but louers of wiſedome.</p>
               <p>But that wee maie meaſure former imaginations of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, with our latter experiences in this cauſe, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what our Aunceſters haue imagined, both of the creation of the Worlde, and the beginnyng of the Creature.</p>

               <p>For the creation of the Yearth, <hi>Archelaus</hi> will haue it of liquide water inflamed by the heate of fire, and by reſolution turned into duſt.</p>

               <p>In theſe opinions our old philoſophers being conuerſant, the farther they looked into the beginning of all thinges, the more they loſte them ſelues: ſo that one of them a moſte profounde clearke called <hi>Simonides,</hi> deſired by <hi>Hiero,</hi> the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to inquire what God was, and demaunding but one dayes reſpite, was in his deepeſt imaginations ſo confounded, that ſeeing the farther he ſought the more he failed, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to ceaſe the attempt, and ſubiect his opinion to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable eſſence of the higheſt.</p>
               <p>In leauing therfore theſe opinions of philoſophers to their Maiſters, we muſt conclude, that the worlde of nothing was made wonderfull, finiſhed in a triuall dignitie which is moſte abſolute, for though in ſixe dayes work the whole Maſſe was finiſhed, yet in three perſons the fabricature was compoſed, and the fabricated redeemed: ſo that in vnequall numbers an vnexplicable wonder was wrought, when as by the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of triuall dignitie the worlde was made, man created, man ſanctified, and man redeemed, by the operation of three perſons in one godhead.</p>
               <p>Some philoſophers (and not vnaptly) by ſerious inſight in this beautifull firmament haue diſtinguiſhed places, apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting firſt a place of reſidence to the Maieſtie, whych is they ſay <hi>Celum Emperium,</hi> next place they <hi>Cristalinum,</hi> the heauen of Cryſtall: nexte in ſeauen circular motions diſtinguiſhe they the planets, appointyng <hi>Saturne</hi> for the firſt, and ſo by diſcent to <hi>Luna,</hi> in theſe vnperfect numbers, and circular motions, placing al the beautie of the heauens, and the glorie of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</p>

                  <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke of common wealth, will needes make a common wealth of diuelles in the ſkies: thus ech hath his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and euerie one a ſeuerall fantaſie, but ſince we certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowe how the Worlde was made, and by the beholding of the ſame, wonder at the workemaiſter, ſince we ſee the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our Philoſophers, that woulde incloſe the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie wythin limites, let vs nowe wade further, and conſider of the operation of the celeſtiall bodies in our terreſtiall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: and herein the vanitie of many are to be wondred at, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing many things to deſtinie &amp; fortune, whereas nothing paſſeth without the prouidence of the higheſt: but for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the higher powers: there is ſome ſimilitude in this, that according to the operation of the planet, the creature is diſpoſed, and if oppoſitions fal contrarious in the heauens, the contrarietie takes effect here on earth: for in truth, man is that table, wherein is included al the ſecretes of nature, and ſo are his members diſpoſed by prouidence, that if by all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection he can conceiue his owne conſtitution: neither can the operation of the planets be hiden from him, nor the nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the earth paſſe his vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, in the the whole maſſe of nature, neither is hidden Arte concluded ſo ſecrete, that is not included in man, neither any effect in things without life, that hath not relation to the liuely ſubſtance, according as the heauens are round, ſo is mans head ſphericall, as the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and intellectiue parte, hath congruence wyth the higher heauens, in which reaſon as in inſcrutable power diſpoſeth al things, and ruleth al things, the ſences which are the orgaines whereby reaſon worketh, though in number they differ, yet in effect they varie not, miniſtring with equal compaſſe to euery member, at the ſpheres wyth one <hi>Sumphonia</hi> inuiron the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>But to paſſe from generalities to particulars, we conclude a <hi>Jouiſt</hi> to be liberall minded, bounteous, faire borne to honors: a <hi>Martiſt</hi> quarrelſome, red haired, auſter lookte, bloudie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, inconſtant: a <hi>Mercurialiſt</hi> a lyar, a theefe, borne elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, ſubtil, and ſuch like: a <hi>Saturniſt,</hi> melancholy, of deepe inſight, ſtedfaſt to perſeuer, commonly wiſe, concluding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:16402:62"/> to the conſtitution wyth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that melancholie men are moſte wittie, and in like ſorte of all the planets.</p>
               <p>Thus ſee wee a certaine hidden working, and agreement paſſing our reatch, which fleightly we may imagine of but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardely we cannot comprehend, wherein we muſt condemne theſe vaine heades, who clyming too high beyond their reach, confound them ſelues in their owne deeming, taking vppon them to knowe other mens fortunes, when they bee ignorant of their owne miſhappes.

               <p>A Comet pretended the birth of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> a Comet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> a vniuerſal darkeneſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the face of the earth, at ſuch time as our ſauiour was crucified: at the creation of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the third of that name, fire from heauen deuoured Church ſteeples in <hi>Rome: Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the founder of that ancient citie, was deuoured by fire from heauen.</p>
               <p>So that we ſee both the heauens worke toward the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the creature, and manace toward the diſſolution of the creature, and yet but as inſtruments of their diuine gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who by the miſteries of his glorie, prefigureth his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture power.</p>
               <p>But leauing this, let vs come to the affinitie betweene Art and Nature, where we are to conſider with the Philoſophers what Nature is: <hi>Tullie</hi> in his <hi>Offices,</hi> hath this ſaying: <hi>If wee folow nature as guyde we ſhall neuer erre,</hi> eſteeming nature for a God, by whome our chiefeſt good fortunes happe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotles</hi> interpreters diuide nature into two formes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the one <hi>Natura Naturans,</hi> and the other <hi>Natura Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi> that nature that naturateth, is that which <hi>Tullie</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for a God: that nature that is naturated, is man.</p>
               <p>If Arte be compared to that whych perfiteth all things, it ſhould ſtriue wyth his founder, but compared wyth his equal,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:63"/> it perfiteth it, ſo that Nature is it which preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the ſubiect, Art, it whych perfecteth the ſubiect: for many naturally are borne wyth inclinations both to good and bad, Art ſearching narrowly into the ſecrets of al things, confiyrmeth according to the diſpoſition, eyther cleanſing that whych was corrupt, or confounding the euill diſpoſed in their owne enormitie.</p>
               <p>The inclination of ſome by nature is to be laſciuious, the correction of the naturall errour by Arte, is to be continent: ſome by nature are borne cowardes, the ſame by Art are made conſtant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zopirus</hi> by exterior ſignes, adiudged <hi>Socrates</hi> to be wanton and vayne headed, who, though hee confeſſed hys naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, yet thus he diſanulled the former propoſition, <hi>Eſſem ita ſi me philoſophia non correxiſſet,</hi> I had beene ſo, had not phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie mended me.</p>
               <p>But as Arte profiteth Nature in ſome things, ſo Nature excelleth Arte in many thyngs, and yet haue theſe two ſo ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued together, that in <hi>Protogenes</hi> table were as fayre grapes in colours, as in Natures gardens, they were in ſubſtaunce: for Nature indeede not onely affecteth the ſight, but alſo the ſenſes, where Art in ſettyng out of colours preſenteth a ſhape wythout a ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But ſo are theſe two knitte together, that if Nature alowe no fenell, Arte can make no fire, if Nature beſtowe no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, we can haue no paynting, and hee that will ſtryue to make an Aſſe eloquent, wil, <hi>inuita Minerua,</hi> worke great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and yet a Crowe could cry <hi>Caeſar,</hi> although Nature allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed her no limites.</p>
               <p>Betwixt both Nature and Arte then, let vs put an <hi>interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> whiche is Vſe: Nature firſt frameth, Arte teacheth, Vſe maketh perfect.</p>
               <p>Arte was ſought out firſt by naturall man, and Arte at firſt confirmed naturall man, yet was there a framer of the one and an inſpirer of the other.</p>
               <p>Some are borne eloquent, yet Art confirmeth them in their eloquence. Some valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet Art compaſſeth their exploites. What ſecrete ſoeuer Art founde out Nature miniſtreth it, and
<pb facs="tcp:16402:63"/> what ſoeuer Nature hath in her bowelles included, Art hath ſought it out.</p>
               <p>So that in ſtriuyng to exceede, thei ſo agree in confirming, that in a learned man it is hard to ſaie, whether Nature or Art preuaile or profite moſt. But for that Nature was before Art, we will in this preferre her: yet if Art and Wiſedome be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiua,</hi> I feare me Nature muſt looſe the ſtirropes, and Art ſet in the ſaddle.</p>
               <p>But as touchyng our laſt propoſition of the inuention and continuation of Artes, truth it is that the opinions of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are ambiguous in theſe pointes: Notwithſtandyng, accordyng to my remembraunce, I will breefly paſſe through ſo many as on this ſodaine my memorie will afforde me, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng that in a Letter for breuitie whiche els would aſke a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
               <p>The firſt foundation of Letters is attributed by ſome to <hi>Mercury,</hi> by other ſome to <hi>Cadmas,</hi> other ſome <hi>Palamedes,</hi> who by the criyng of Cranes added fower letters to the Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: ſome to <hi>Simonides Melicus,</hi> other to <hi>Anticlides</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> but thoſe of latter memorie as <hi>Crinitus</hi> reporte, that in a certaine Library this Monument was left for memorie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Wiſe Moſes firſt the Hebrue letters found,</l>
                  <l>And wiſe Phaenices firſt prefixt the Greeke:</l>
                  <l>Nicostrata the Latine letters made,</l>
                  <l>And Abraham Syras the Caldean taught,</l>
                  <l>And Iſis ſhe the Aegiptian letters ſhode,</l>
                  <l>The Croſrowe of the Getes Gulfila wrote.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Logicke</hi> had his firſt originall of <hi>Zeno: Polihimnia</hi> inuented <hi>Rhetoricke: Thalia</hi> Poetrie, <hi>Alcmenon Crotomates</hi> naturall Philoſophie: <hi>Ihon</hi> of <hi>Aegipt</hi> Phiſicke: <hi>Tuball</hi> Muſicke, yet ſome father it on <hi>Appollo, Theuth</hi> Arethmeticke, <hi>Erato</hi> Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitrie: <hi>Abraham</hi> Aſtronomie, <hi>Zoroaſtes</hi> Kyng of the <hi>Bactri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> the <hi>Metaphisickes.</hi> As for the Manuell artes as they are not of ſuch excellencie as the other, ſo labour I lefe about their originall, yet to touch them ſomewhat and their founders, <hi>Noe</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16402:64"/> inuented Tillage, <hi>Proteus</hi> &amp; <hi>Acriſius</hi> Warlike Inſtruments, <hi>Bellecophon</hi> Horſeridyng, <hi>Danaus</hi> by Shippe firſt ſhapt courſe into <hi>Greece:</hi> The <hi>Carthagians</hi> inuented traffique of Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, <hi>Phidon</hi> Chariottes, <hi>Giges</hi> Paintyng.</p>
               <p>Thus Artes had their originall by diligent inueſtigation of the inſight into Nature, and are continued vnto theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, wherein we finde that as the age chaungeth, ſo the faſhion altereth, and that Nature and Arte are at ſuche an atonement, that what ſo, either in the center of the earth may be found out to worke vpon ſhall be miniſtred: and what ſo, either memorie maie alowe Art ſhall perfect: and what is obſcured by tyme, ſhall be made newe beyng againe renued.</p>
               <p>But for that (good Gentleman) the taſke I prefixed is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the Sunne alreadie ſettled in the Weſt perſwades vs to ſleapyng, if it pleaſe you we will here make an end, beſeeching you to beare with a Scholers rudeneſſe, who accordyng to the Talent his ſtudies haue afforded hym, hath diſcourſed thus long to doe you pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides</hi> greatly pleaſed with this clearkly diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thus: truly <hi>Philesius,</hi> I knowe not whether I ſhould more prayſe thee for thy learnyng, or commend thee for thyne eloquence, the one is ſo ſingular, the other ſo ſufficient: but my concluſion is (for that I would be loath to be troubleſome) that thou haſt deſerued the name of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> wyſhing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy repoſe, to be made ſtil partaker of thy purpoſes. In ſuch like commendations, <hi>Simonides</hi> diſcourſing wyth <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> was finally interrupted thus:</p>
               <p>To apply prayſe to thoſe that alow it not, is to miniſter water to increaſe flame, I had rather be in deede, than to bee prayſed in word, but let vs ſlip ouer theſe vnneceſſarie praiſes, and to morrowe we wil fall to ſome other ſuch diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>They both beyng agreede, betooke them ſelues to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, where I leaue them to their reſt, til on the morrow at the Sunne, <hi>Philesius</hi> not accuſtomed to ſleepe exceſſiuely tooke the hatches, and calling <hi>Simonides</hi> vp, whome he founde faſte a ſleepe, hee merily in this ſort ieſted with hym.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth by your wakefulneſſe, that you haue ſtudied A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomie
<pb facs="tcp:16402:64"/> too little, or affected ſlouthfulneſſe too much, that you can ſuffer the goodlieſt comforter of the world to ſhine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and you ſleeping ſoundly, ſcarce to ſalute hym.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell by what benefite it falleth out <hi>Philesius</hi> ꝙ <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> but ſo ſweete thys nights ſleepe hath beene to me, as all my houres forepaſſed (in compariſon of this) ſeemeth but a dreame.</p>
               <p>And good reaſon (ſayd <hi>Philesius</hi>) for ſeeing your dayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe was not vaine, it muſt needes followe you ſhoulde ſleepe ſounde, for the fantaſie is neuer troubled wyth dreaming, but when the bodie and mind by day haue employed themſelues, in practiue exerciſe, or exceſſiue diet.</p>
               <p>Yes by your leaue (ſaid <hi>Simonides</hi>) ſome Dreames there be that not onely be fortune in the temperateſt bodies, but alſo bee foretokens of ſome fortune to come.</p>
               <p>Herein I agrée with you (ſaied <hi>Phileſius</hi>) but theſe are in an other kinde then thoſe Dreames we talke of: for although thei maie borowe the name of a Dreame, yet in nature they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations: For in Dreames there are diſtinctions bothe aloted by the Poetes, and alowed by the Philoſophers, attributyng one to men, the other to beaſtes: for the phantaſie, it worketh on inſenſible thynges, and in dreamyng, not onely by the power of the higheſt a certaine inwarde knowledge of the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſoule is gathered, but alſo certaine forewarninges ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of good or ill are prefigured. For ſuche Dreames as haue their originall only of the diſpoſition of phantaſie, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and operation of humours, they as incident to bruite beaſtes neede little diſcourſe. For ſuche as proceede of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of the mynde, which troubled with that it wrought vpon by daie, now hath operation and workyng of it by night, that I leaue to thy conſideration, wiſhyng thee but to obſerue the qualitie of the cauſe and the order of the workyng.</p>
               <p>For thoſe Dreames that in deede haue Deuinitie in them, in whiche hidden ſecrete miſteries be preſented, of them I will (for pleaſures ſake) prefixe thee ſome example, and afterward I will betake my ſelf to my priuate contemplation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Genadius</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> a man deepely ſeene in the Arte of
<pb facs="tcp:16402:65"/> medicine, doubtyng of the immortalitie of the ſoule, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to periſh with the bodie, beholding in his ſleepe at two ſeuerall times, a yong man ſtandyng before hym, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him wyth the portrature of a faire citie, and the nexte night returnyng vnto him, he demaunded of the phiſition if he knew him, who aunſwered, that he knew him, and forgate not his dreame, and demaunded by the ſame yong man agayne, where his bodie was, hee aunſwered in his bed, yet confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſtrangeneſſe of his knowledge, that ſleepyng verie ſoundly, he coulde yet make relation of the ſtate of his bodie, by theſe meanes gatheryng it was the workyng of his ſoule, he reuoked his errour, and what by long ſtudie hee coulde not compaſſe, by a little dreame he founde out, and was throughly confirmed, that the ſoule was immortall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cirill</hi> reporteth this dreame to haue fortuned to hym ſelfe, beyng in his bed, and after he had finiſhed his prayers, that hee was fallen aſleepe, it ſeemed vnto him, that he felt an vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable and horrible ſtench, whych the ſenſe not admittyng, at laſt, the dead bodie of his owne kinſman called <hi>Rufus</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto hym loaden and chained with greate iron ſhackles, vomityng out of his mouth, fierie flames, and ſendyng from out all partes of his bodie innumerable ſparkles, and tokens of the inwarde fire that was kindled wythin his breaſt, whome thus beholdyng wyth intollerable feare and compaſſion of minde, he at laſte with tremblyng voice as miniſter of hys feareful heart, demaunded of hym thus: O <hi>Rufus,</hi> how falleth it out that thou liuyng as thou diddeſt in moſt bleſſed behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our accompted of for the integritie of thy life of all men, and ſhouldeſt bee thus tormented.</p>
               <p>Alas <hi>Cirillus</hi> aunſwered <hi>Rufus,</hi> thou art deceiued, for theſe plagues are laied vppon mee onely for the looſneſſe of my life, for my leude liuyng, my Dieyng and vnlawfull Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng, hath brought me to bee puniſhed with ſo many horrible plagues.</p>
               <p>With theſe wordes the Viſion auoyded, and <hi>Cirillus</hi> with feare awakyng, reportes this wonder.</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee (Gentleman) that the mynde is affected
<pb facs="tcp:16402:65"/> when the bodie ſleapeth, and wonders are opened in dreames, to confirme wakyng men in vertues.</p>
               <p>Some in dreames receiue inſpirations of knowledge as <hi>Aeſchilus</hi> did, who tendyng his fathers vines beyng a childe, in a dreame was warned by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to write tragedies, who makyng proofe of his cunnyng beyng waked, founde his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to performe indeede, that whych before hee had imagined but in dreame.</p>
               <p>And for that I haue priuate ſtudies to applie, I am forced to end abruptly, wherevpon, leauyng you to your pleaſures good Gentleman) I take my leaue, and thus with a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall becke <hi>Phileſius</hi> departed to his Cabbin, and <hi>Simonides</hi> continued his muſing of the accidentes forepaſt, and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng at the effectes of learnyng, he brake into theſe tearmes.</p>
               <p>O vnſearchable ſecrete of Philoſophie, by whiche Art firſt was knowne, Nature ſought into, Weales publique begun, common Weales gouerned. How happie are thei that haue the poſſeſſion of thee? How blinded in errour are thoſe that are without thee? O bleſſed <hi>Euphues,</hi> who ſeyng the ſweete of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, haſt refrained to bee worldly and attained to bee happie. How fortunate is that ſoule whiche is partaker of the ſecretes of the Gods, and by learnyng and ſerious ſtudie hath compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the deuinitie of it ſelf? What booteth perfections of the bodie, when the mynd is vnperfect. For beautie, who doubteth but that other creatures excell men: but it is wiſedome onely that beautifieth.</p>
               <p>Oh vnhappie <hi>Simonides</hi> that left <hi>Ciuill</hi> for Loue and not for Learnyng. From this tyme forthe duryng the tyme thei were on the Sea, <hi>Simonides</hi> onely ſolicited hymſelf in the company of <hi>Phileſius,</hi> till the Maiſter of the Ship comfortyng his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers tolde them that thei were vpon the Coaſt, and that he doubted not but ſhortly he ſhould ſee <hi>Sandwiche:</hi> Theſe newes made the companie frolicke, and as tyme bringeth all thynges to end, ſo after eight weekes ſailyng thei attained the harbour: wherevpon <hi>Simonides</hi> beyng ſet a Shore with <hi>Phileſius</hi> in his companie, he feaſted hymſelf and the Philoſopher (beyng both ouerwearied at the Sea) with ſuche dainties as the Towne
<pb facs="tcp:16402:66"/> could preſently afforde them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phileſius</hi> perceiuyng the haſt <hi>Simonides</hi> made on his Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he hymſelf not yet prepared to beare hym companie, gaue hym this freendly farewell.</p>
               <p>Noble Spanyard, as thy affection is great to learnyng, ſo I praie thee make thy knowledge aunſwerable to thy deſire, and when opertunitie ſhall ſerue thee to fall to thy ſtudies, I beſeeche thee forget not to ſearch Philoſophie: for findyng her ſhe will feede thee. The Gods proſper thee in thy trauailes and me in my ſtudies, and for that I ſee thou haſt haſte on thy waie, I will no longer trouble thee, but bid thee hartely fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simonides</hi> giuyng hym freendly thankes, preſently tooke order for the conueying of his neceſſaries to <hi>London,</hi> and being mounted on Horſebacke, by conuenient Iourneyes he came to the Citie.</p>

               <p>Herein are they more to be wondered at for their wiſedome (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) who with quicke capacitie can comprehende euery thyng, and with wittie concluſions can finiſhe as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſuche like deuiſes thei paſſed the tyme till ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ſerued in, where neither delicates were wantyng, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther varietie of Muſicke, nor delectable diſcourſe, ſo that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> aſtonied at the braue behauiour of the Ladies, the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie dainties of their repaſt, and the ſweete harmonie of the Muſicke, was reuiued by Ladie <hi>Fraunces</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth courteous Gentleman, that you haue certaine ceremonies to performe you ſit ſo ſadly, I am ſorry amongſt ſo many of our poore pleaſures, no one of them will wring one ſmile from your heauie countenaunce.</p>
               <p>Truely (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) you are miſtaken, for neither am I ſo holy as to meditate to muche, nor in ſo pleaſaunt moode, to laughe at euery conceite, if ought amaſe me, it is rather the excellencie of that I beholde, then the cogitation of that which I thought not of.</p>
               <p>My thought is the leſſe ſir (ſaied ſhe) and your welcome the more, but how like you <hi>Englande</hi> ſaied Madame <hi>Fraunces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I ſhould doe Ladie (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) it is pleaſaunt in Climat, populus in Cities, plenteous in dainties, ſtorde with braue perſonages, and full of faire women. Not ſo faire as in <hi>Ciuill,</hi> ſaied Ladie <hi>Fraunces,</hi> it maie be in myne opinion (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) not hauyng as yet ſeene but little, but if hereafter I light of a more faire proſpect, I will not doubt Madame to make you priuie to my opinion, meane while, I conceiue this, if al be as faire as the Miſtris of this houſe, no maruell though <hi>Italians</hi> leaue <hi>Naples</hi> to dwell at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this tyme the Table was taken awaie, and euery Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb facs="tcp:16402:67"/> ſtraunger had his welcome, and as the cuſtome of the Countrey is after Supper, thei betooke themſelues to diſport eche as fitted his owne fanſie. Amongſt the reſt, the Miſtris of the houſe takyng <hi>Simonides</hi> by the hand, and ioynyng vnto him other Gentlemen and Ladies of the companie, ſaied thus. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Simonides,</hi> as this Countrey guiſe of diſporte is after their repaſt to reaſon, ſo will I acquaint you now with the orders, becauſe that findyng your capacitie to be ſo execellent as it is, I maie imploye you to be a moderator, amongſt ſuche vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced reaſons as we poore Ladies be.</p>
               <p>If you reaſon no worſe Madame (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) then he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto yet you haue diſcourſed, I thinke I ſhall haue greater reaſon to giue eare and bee ſilent, then enterruptyng a ſweete tale with a ſower cenſure, ſhall rather ſhame my ſelf then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the companie.</p>
               <p>You ſaie well ſir (ſaied the Ladie) yet you maie not wring out with this wyle, wherefore Gentlemen, I praie let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, to enterpriſe a diſcourſe, for on my word I haue fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you with a conuenient moderater.</p>
               <p>At her requeſt thei all condeſcended, among the whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely yong Gentleman called <hi>Siluius</hi> began thus.</p>
               <p>Since you haue begun (Madame) to enterpriſe, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him that ſhall diſpoſe, maie it pleaſe you to order how the diſputation ſhal paſſe, and then with more conformitie we may goe forwarde.</p>
               <p>Bee it ſo <hi>Siluius</hi> (ſaied Madame <hi>Fraunces</hi>) and accordyng as you intimat you ſhall firſt reaſon with Miſtris <hi>Claudia, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellus</hi> with <hi>Secrobia,</hi> and <hi>Furnelius</hi> with me.</p>
               <p>As for hym that ſhall conclude, you knowe who is enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Segnior Simonides,</hi> vpon this concluſion, we all are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue <hi>Segnior Siluius:</hi> And I will not bee long ſilent, ſaide hee, wherevpon turnyng himſelfe wyth a curteous regard toward Maiſtreſſe <hi>Claudia,</hi> he beganne thus:</p>
               <p>There is a puniſhment (faire Maiſtreſſe <hi>Claudia</hi>) amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> that by the drinckyng of a bitter poyſon, the body in ſleepe, is ſo tormented wyth horrible viſions, that wakyng it doth deſtroy and ſubuert it ſelfe, as in thoſe tortures, ſo in
<pb facs="tcp:16402:68"/> theſe attempts, it is not onely a puniſhment prefixed to talke againſt loue, for commonly the moſte contemners are ſubiect to this miſchiefe, that taſtyng their fill of fancie, they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in nights dreames beholde their dayes ſorrow, but alſo by daye diſcontinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap> their wakyng happineſſe, whiche makes me now, ſo to prefixe limites to my arguing, that beyng loath to commit an errour, yet am not I willyng to commende too much, wherevppon, if it pleaſe you, wee will reaſon whether beautie be more commendable in a baſe borne creature, than in hir that is ſprong of noble parentage: and for that I wil leaue you that which belongeth to your ſelfe, beyng deſcended of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable parentes: I meane to maintayne this, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of beautie is more commendable in hir that is ſprong by progenie of ſmall regarde, than in hir that is beautifull and enriched with many titles of honour.</p>
               <p>My reaſons be theſe, firſt nature is emploid more ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than minde can conceiue, when on thiſtles ſhee grafteth ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or on the hurtfull hemlocke, the hurtleſſe hearbgrace, in the deformed wombe, a perfect ſubſtance, when groſe humors, homely feedyng, and diſordered diet, worke both in actiue and paſſiue ſubſtances, if there were not more than a ſupernatural workyng, we muſte conclude, that the female ſhoulde be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to manie defaults, and humours eyther abandonyng or defaulting in Nature, the babe ſhoulde be either a monſter or changelyng in proportion: ſo that, by howe muche the more the rare effects of Nature are to bee wondred at, by ſo muche the wonderfull benefites of beautie are to be commended.</p>
               <p>And with ſome hidden reaſon, the powers beſtow theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites on pouertie, that where they haue not miniſtred to it in worldly honours, they forget not to recompence in ſeemely ſimilitudes: ſo that it muſte be concluded, that Nature more ſtrangely worketh in vnnoble than in noble, when from ſo baſe ſubſtances, ſo ſweete a perfection is gathered. So that I feare me, if there were the like cuſtome in <hi>England,</hi> as was at <hi>Elida,</hi> that ſhee that was the beautifulleſt, ſhould bee crowned in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of honour, I doubt not but our baſe borne beautifull, might ſacrifice a target to <hi>Minerua,</hi> when our braueſt courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:68"/> and Ladies of greateſt honour, ſhoulde be but miniſtrs to accompliſhe the ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And it would ſo fall out, that the faire maidens of <hi>Tenidos,</hi> ſhould carrie away the bucklers, when our beautifull damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of <hi>Troy</hi> were to be depriued of their honour they ſo ſtriue for.</p>
               <p>But to make my reaſons more forcible, I muſte inferre this, what ſo a noble minde beautified wyth all titles of honor deſireth, muſt be concluded to be both rare and wonderful, but the beautie of hir that is borne but of vnnoble pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued mightie Emperours, and therefore more to be maruailed at.</p>
               <p>For you faire damoſells, the abundance of your wealth, the promotions of your fathers, the expectation of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure makes you to be ſought after, and to bee ſued to, when as they hauyng none of theſe poſſibilities to preferre them, are as curteouſly intreated as your ſelues, and more accompted of, than many of you.</p>
               <p>It was a lawe amongſt the Lacedemonians, that who in battell had gained victorie, ſhoulde in the preſence of the king be crowned with garlands of honor, wherevpon noble Iudge, I muſt now requeſt you, that ſeeing I haue concluded ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, I may be rewarded wyth honour accordingly.</p>
               <p>Maiſtreſſe <hi>Claudia</hi> conceiuyng his concluſion, chopte him this aunſwere, who triumphs before the victorie, may ſooner carrie a fagot for his penaunce than weare a garlande for his honour. <hi>Stichicus</hi> might ſtriue with <hi>Hercules</hi> in ſleight matter of pleaſure, but if he chalenge the combat, he might haue a cold comfort in his proceedynges.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Signior Siluius</hi> it will fare with you, who in matters of pleaſure like the Lambe maie plaie with the Lyon, but if you ſtretche paſt your compaſſe, you maie happe to haue a clindge for your labour, neither ought you to claime the rewarde of victorie, ſince with moſt certaine demonſtration I will defend, and with more probabilitie I wil conclude, that beautie in the Noble is more commendable, then in thoſe of obſcure name it is praiſe worthie. In good ſooth tell me <hi>(Signior Siluius)</hi> is not
<pb facs="tcp:16402:69"/> the Sunne more beautifull in the Firmament, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie of the cloudes defaceth it not, than when it is ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed wyth darkeneſſe: is not the delectable ſent of the Roſe more commendable, when it is mixed with his companions in Nature, than ouerpreſſed with vnſauorie ſmelles, I ſee not but that the moone is more faire amidſt the glimſing ſtarres, than amongeſt the ſhrowdes of darkeneſſe, and affects the eie ſight with more pleaſure, and the trauailer with greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte.</p>
               <p>Place beautie in an honourable perſonage, and it hath affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with an honourable minde, which maketh it ſo much the more to be wondred at: As for the matching beautie in a baſe perſonage, it is to put pearles in a ſwines noſtrels, to pricke floures in a filthie donghill, or to dreſſe an Aſſe in a Lyons ſkinne.</p>
               <p>I can bring you many that were noblie borne, that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in all profeſſions, but for them that are obſcure in byrth, neuer founde I anie, neither if I did would I beleeue it.</p>
               <p>A beautifull noble woman brought vp in vertuous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is a preſident to thoſe that folow after, who with emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will contend to exceede or match hir at the leaſt. But when a beautifull in noble ſhall fortune by wonderfull deſtinies to growe to great perfection, what imitation ſhal wee finde or ſucceſſion amongſt theſe obſcure maidens.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Segnior Siluius.</hi> I conclude, and you muſt confeſſe, that my reaſons are the ſtronger, and for that I wil not be tedious, I leaue the reſte to the diſcretion of the Iudge.</p>
               <p>The whole companie alowing this methodicall contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after ſome pawſe, were attentiue to heare the ſecond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, when as <hi>Fauellus</hi> a noble Gentleman, and one well nurtured, turned to <hi>Secr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bia,</hi> and ſaide thus:</p>
               <p>Madame, ſince wee twoo muſt enter diſputation, I would ſo fitte you, that eche might be partaker of the pleaſure of the ſubiect, and the eloquent deliuerie of your diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon, if you pleaſe, we will argue thus: if in choice of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, you were to be limited betweene twoo perſonages,
<pb facs="tcp:16402:69"/> whether would you alow of the Souldior for your bedfellow, or the Courtier for your huſband?</p>
               <p>Truly <hi>Fauellus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Secrobia</hi>) I alow wel of the Souldior, but I muſt yeelde the priſe to the Courtier.</p>
               <p>And I Madame (ſaide <hi>Fauellus</hi>) wil prooue the Souldiour more worthie to be alowed of, and a more meete man to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and this not without reaſon: firſte, for perſonage moſt commonly he is as perfect as the beſte, for bedde pleaſures, Idoubte not as actiue as the moſte, in diſcourſe, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, in loue as ſtedefaſt, his affections are not ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the Courtiers, for that his life is not ſo laſciuious, if thine honour be depraued, he wil reuenge it, if thou be ſubiect to any imperfection, he will beare with it, for it muſte needes folow, that he who winketh at ſo many outrages in his Soul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dior, wil not be much incenſed with a womans naturall fragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: their eies are chaſte in all places. But where they loue, their actions more honourable when they remember them of their beloued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> that noble <hi>Macedon,</hi> though he had in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection the wife of <hi>Darius</hi> and his beautifull daughters, hee woulde not violate them, whereas I feare mee if a Courtier were ſo faire offered, he woulde haue made one of them, ſing a fa burthen while he were deſcanting a loft.</p>
               <p>A ſouldiour perhaps may bee accompted bloudie minded, and therfore not mete for a delicate damoſels bed, but in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it were better to marrie a man than a meacocke, for the Souldiour offereth no rigour but to his enimie, if hee be diſpleaſed, it is with ſuch as enuie the felicitie of his Miſtris: the Courtier perhaps ſhutes it out in better colours, but the Souldiour hauing no fine phraſes to pleaſe humours, laieth it on with plaine truthe, whiche is the plea of him that in loue wil prooue moſt conſtant.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I muſt conclude (miſtris <hi>Secrobia</hi>) that either you muſt proue affectionate in your choice, or peruerſe in reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, makyng election of the worſer and leauinge the better, and on this concluſion I refer my ſelf to iudgment.</p>
               <p>And to this concluſion I ſhape this aunſwer (ſaied <hi>Secrobia</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:16402:70"/> though you haue tied me within limites of election <hi>(Signior Fauellus)</hi> yet I will ſuſſpend my reſolut iudgment, and for that you ſhall not thinke by your reaſon thus to win the goole, thus much for the courtier.</p>
               <p>Who ſo in all actions moſt fitteth wonens fantaſies. is moſt conuenient to be alowed, but Courtiers are thei that moſt con: ueniently ſatiſfie faire Ladies likynges, and therefore meteſt to be had in wedlocke.</p>
               <p>For the truth is ſo, that whereas faire demoſeles are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſeamlineſſe, modeſt pleaſure, with like courtly behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: ſuch thinges are moſt agreable to their delicate humours, and therefore it cannot bee but that a Courtiour muſt bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted who is the onely man for this purpoſe to furniſh them in that thei looke for.</p>
               <p>The Courtiour with ſeamly parſonage, with honourable behauiour, with philed phraſes, with ſweet muſicke, and with twentie amarous deuices will delude the time ſo pretely, that we Laidies can not imagine them, but to be the onely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to procure our pleaſure.</p>
               <p>In the Soldiour, what reſteth there either to be wondreth at or wiſhed for that the Courtiour wanteth, in the Courtiour, is there any thing miſſyng in whiche he exceedeth not the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, the Courtiour is as good a horſeman, as practiſed a man at armes, as valiaunt to defend his miſtris, yea more reſolute in beauties cauſe, they ſtand on euery light tearme of honour, not ſufferyng the leaſt ſtaine to take hould of their gentrie.</p>
               <p>The Soldiour is fed withe murthers, delighted in blodſhed, the memorie of whoſe maſſakers, would make the memorie of his pleaſures moſt loothſome. And <hi>Signior Fauellus,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenencie whiche you impute to Soldiours, aledging the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Alexander</hi> that would not regarde the beautie of <hi>Darius</hi> wife &amp; daughters, imagiyyng thereby the chaſtitie of Soldiors myndes, I can not by this excuſe your groſe imagination, but doe rather thinke Soldiours to be ſo betle blinded that thei are not able to diſtreye the perfection of beautie: or els compoſed of ſo baſe a ſubſtaunce not to eſtem of ſo rare a benifit, as hath mad the wiſeſt to ſtoupe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:70"/>
               <p>The Courtiour continueth in one comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Courtiour pretermitteth not a daie without varietie of delight, lyberall he is in expence, bountifull to her he honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he reſpecteth not either this occaſion of conqueſt, or that bootie to inriche him, but acountes his chefeſt felicitie in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of beautie, and to doe faire Ladies ſeruice, and ſhould not thei (thinke you) be to vnkynde, that would forget the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of ſo louing Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Truely <hi>Fauellus</hi> I muſt conclude my fancie with faire Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies opinions (for I take my ſelf ſometimes to be one of their preuie counſaile) that Soldiours are more fitter for the feilde, then for the feilde bed: more meter for a maſſacre, then for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: And the Courtiour to be the onely neceſſarie man, that fitteth to worke a faire Ladies pleaſure. If this be not true, I referr me to the iuſt determination of this gentleman our iudg.</p>
               <p>All the companie laughed hartely at this mery concluſion, till ſuch tyme as madame <hi>Eraunces</hi> diſcourſed thus.</p>
               <p>Sith the matter is ſorted out thus farr (gentle <hi>Furnelius</hi>) I will now ſtreine curtiſie with you and inuert the order, and becauſe my memorie is but brittle, I will begin the ſoner leaſt I forget the latter.</p>
               <p>Your profeſſion (I dout not) is ſuch good ſir, as you which haue practiſed the profit thereof ſo long, are not now to ſeeke how to praiſe it, whereupon at this preſent, I meane to argue thus. Whether the Lawyer or the Phiſition be more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in a ſtate, I will defend the Lawyer, for you as beeyng a Phiſition by profeſſion, you maie the better defend ſince you are the more practiſed.</p>
               <p>The profeſſer of the law, if he had naught els to commend hym, the verie name it ſelf would make it praiſe worthy, for by the lawes good diſciplines are preſcribed, the ſtate gouerned, and all policies to the maintenaunce of peace, both begun, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and ended.</p>
               <p>The Lawyer, knowyng the puniſhment of all errours, and
<pb facs="tcp:16402:71"/> findyng him ſelf to be a preſident in all good demeaner, ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him ſelf as when he but paſſeth the ſtreates as <hi>Cato Cenſer</hi> did, all <hi>Rome</hi> refraineth idleneſſe and becommeth well ocupied, he purgeth the ſtate of ſuſpitious inconueniences, he preſcribeth in the Commenwealth ſuch preuentions as that an errour now ſpronge vp can neither take head nor be contenued, no not in thoſe of great countenaunce the profeſſer of the law hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leade him, conſcience to direct him, iuſtice to counſell him, honour to reward him. In his life he is vertuous, in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes conſtant, in his iudgementes vpright, in his pleadynges vncorrupte, in concluſion, he is the onely neceſſarie membre in a ſtate, by whom the Noble are counſailed, the ſubiect kept in awe, and the truth is, that the Common wealth is vnhappie, whereas the Lawyer hath not both preferment by his practiſe, and poure to reproue what he miſliketh.</p>
               <p>It was a Lawyer (yea and a learned practiſer of the ſcience <hi>Apius Claudius</hi>) who when the whole ſenate and ſtate hunge in ſuſſpence by the approch of the enimie, not onely counſailed that whiche was profitable, but alſo preferred thoſe preceptes which were honourable for his cuntrie: neither yet knew I any regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fortunate, where either the Prince was ſelf opinionatiue not reſpectyng lawe or the ſubiect ſo diſſolute that he regarded not the Lawyer. As for you Docter <hi>Furnelias,</hi> if your potions be wholſome, thei are as perlions to the Soule as thei are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the bodie, for your pacient beyng once reſtored to health, he is made prone to put in practiſe euery kynd of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: againe, your medicine is commodious but to one perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer perſon, but where one good <hi>Axiome</hi> paſſeth from a Lawyer, it is not a ſole pleaſure, but in truth it is publiquely commodions</p>
               <p>If then, by the dignitie practiſe and profit, the law as moſt commendable, the profeſſer of force muſt not faile of prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, whom ſince I haue concluded for a more neceſſary perſon, I doubt not but the iudge will determine, that in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ate he is moſt profitable.</p>
               <p>Here ceaſed Ladie <hi>Fraunces</hi> when thus the graue Docter began his diſcourſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16402:71"/>
               <p>Madam perhappes (as commonly amongſt Ladies it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out) your Ladiſhipe rather deameth vppon affection then iudgement, whiche makethe you ſo parcially to thinke of the Lawyer, and ſo iudicially to condemne the Phiſition, but if a burnyng feeuour as now had handfaſt of your bodie, I fere me you would rather ſacrifice to <hi>Aſculapius,</hi> then ſhake handes with <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> perſwaded by profe &amp; experience in this that a medicine can alay that in the body which moral preceptes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſwage, and that the Phiſition in extreamitie of ſicknes is your Godes good, where nowe in your diſcourſe he is ſmally accounted of.</p>
               <p>As man is made but of Soule and bodie, ſo nexte the Soule the health of the bodie is to be preſerued before worldly pelf, and as richeſſe are but ſlaues to miniſter to the bodies want, ſo the greateſt commendation that may be giuen to a Lawyer is but in iuſtice to giue euery one his owne, yet this farre vncomper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Phiſition, that giueth euerie one his health. But admit what you haue ſaied to be true, that the Lawyer is to be thought worthy the commendation you haue giuen him, yet the Phiſition is he that continueth him his health, and then I doubt not but you will conclude, that the perfiter is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then the perfited, and that he that miniſtreth perfection to the Lawyer, is of more excelencie then the Lawyer. If ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhould take hold on your moſt vpright iuſticer, by whom (as you conclude) the whole ſtate is releaued by, I praie you then who is ſent for, is not the Phiſition ſued vnto, then runnes this Ladie for that preſeruatiue, now for that preparatiue, againe for this purgation, and ſhould not the humour by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke be expelled, our Lawyer might bid goodnight to his frendes, is it not then true that the Phiſition is to be preferred when he not onely is a good membre in a Commonwealth, but alſo continueth in good health the ſtaies and vpholders of the ſtate. If the memorie be ill, phiſicke will recouer it: if the bodie be conſumed, a medicine will helpe it: if beautie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, phiſicke will reſtore it: and madame, can you find in hart to ſpeake ill of ſo neceſſary members. He that muſt be a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion &amp; a maiſter in his ſcience, muſt be able to ſearch into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:16402:72"/> of the Heauens, the courſe of the Planetes, the diſtintio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tymes, the operations of complextions whereas to be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lawyer requireth no great art, but a diſcrete iudgment, a good memorie, with a fewe principles, ſo that the concluſions of law maie be comprehended in 20 yeares limet, where to be a good Phiſition requireth <hi>Neſtors</hi> yeares.</p>
               <p>Yea, madam, for that you ſhall know the Phiſition is as profitable and as expert in ſtate as any others, doe but marke this, that in the tyme of <hi>Eugenus</hi> the thirde, at a general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaill, a Phiſition interteinynge the whole rablement of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Philoſophers of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and at that ſityng, not onely aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them to their depeſt opoſitions, but alſo confounded them in their owne groundes, and not without reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that perfiteth the memoryes of others can bee, without the ſame perfection by which he worketh.</p>
               <p>Truly faire Ladies if you were examined vppon your conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences, how many of you would proue kind pacientes to your Phiſitions, and confeſſe that vnleſſe our medicines had ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alaied ſome humours would haue proued ouer lawleſſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to be corrected with a common Lawyers cautions, although in your Ladiſhippes opinion, now thei muſt haue the preheminence.</p>
               <p>But good madame ſince we haue referred all to an arbiter and iudge, I requeſt you ſuſpend your iudgement and leaue it to his diſcretion, who beyng a ſtraunger and hauing in trauell gathered many experiences, will not faile to conclude accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to diſcretion, and preferre the perſon accordyng as his deſertes inable him.</p>
               <p>Why ſaied madam <hi>Fraunces, Signior Simonides,</hi> the whole reſteth in you, who to conclude this our nightes diſport, are onely to furniſh vs of a iudgment touchyng all our doubtes.</p>
               <p>And I madame accordyng to the tenuite of my iudgment, will fulfill what you haue inioyned me, although I am bound in theſe cauſes to ſome extreamyties.</p>
               <p>Since you <hi>Signior Siluius</hi> confirme a wonder, Miſtris <hi>Claudia</hi> a meruell, beautie as I eſteame (faire Ladies) as it was firſt made incomprehenſible by reaſon of excelencie, ſo is
<pb facs="tcp:16402:72"/> it not beſtowed but vppon rare perſonages: for nature in the firſt compoſition of all creatures, proportioned the beautifull in ſuch forme, as if <hi>Ethinick</hi> poetes may preuaile to perſwade, it not onely bewitcheth the Godes, but alſo intangleth the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, ſo that where the benifit of beauty is imploied, ther bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perſon is to be wondered at the powers, by hidden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie adequat the delight of the one, with the perfection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not vouchſafing beautifull brightneſſe but on the ſunne, nor faire face but on an honourable perſonag, willyng on this to contenue their wonted equalitie, who beſtow all graces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, not ſufferyng beautie to dround honour, nor honour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede beautie, ſo that when nature bendeth at my tyme to the baſer, it is but to ſhew that ſhe can of infamous make noble, and of baſe borne beautiful yet notwithſtanding, as the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter generally beſtowith all his beſt coullers on the ſweeteſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulytudes, ſo nature moſt commonly beſtoweth her rareſt per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fections on the roialleſt ſubſtaunce, immitatynge herein the courſe of the world, where there is haboundaunce, there more ſhall be beſtowed, and he that is preſſed with penurie, muſt ſtil be contented to bide the penaunce.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Signior Siluius,</hi> herein I muſt depriue you of that you wiſhe for, in that you commende that whiche onely is but probably true, where this Gentlewoman hauyng experience in theſe diſpoſitions, hath iudicially concluded, leauyng me a bad ſcipher to finiſhe vp her ſentence.</p>
               <p>But for you <hi>Signior Fauellus,</hi> who hath entered into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of deuine creatures, bindyng womens likynges within limites, I muſt vſe you and your reſolutions as the <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophagie</hi> vſe their enemies, who fat them then moſt exceſſiuely, when thei entende to murther them cruelly, ſo alowyng you a little ſcope to confirme the plauſibilitie of your witte, I muſt with the ſame reaſons diſſwade by which you confirme, ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng you with your owne rodde, and maiſteryng you in your owne concluſions, Miſtris <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>robia</hi> muſt haue the day and you the diſaſter.</p>
               <p>You growe in commendation of Soldiours, in whom what note you but conſtauncie (and that is a vertue) in whom what
<pb facs="tcp:16402:73"/> alowe you but valewe, (and that placed as it ought to bee is a black ſwane) yet who fitteth the faire Cambrick with a black ſtaine, and the ſweete Amber with the rancke Mandrake, ſhall find he hath but acquainted an Aſſe with eloquence, &amp; a Plow man with Philoſophie.</p>
               <p>Are Soldiours conſtaunt <hi>(Fauellus)</hi> it is then in vnconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? Are Soldiours valiaunt <hi>(Fauellus)</hi> it is then in extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and I thinke who neuer doeth well before he be vrged, his well doyng is not praiſe worthie, for where the action is not freely enterpriſed, though the ſucceſſe be neuer ſo fortunate, the vnwillyng attempt concludes an vnworthie exigent.</p>
               <p>It is a Soldiour that you would make a Ladies maiſter, and faire Damoſelles vouchſafe not to accept ſo baſe fellowes to bee their ſeruauntes, ſo then in myne opinion wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he that will prefixe raines to womens fantaſies, and would preſcribe them limites to keepe them within compaſſe, muſt both bid the repulſe of his vniuſt compariſon, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed of Iudgement when he ſeekes to conclude that whiche is infinite.</p>
               <p>A Courtier is a collop of pleaſure, whiche was firſt bred to feede Ladies with varietie, and to ſucke the Marrowe of the youth, and to determine the pleaſures of their age.</p>
               <p>A Soldiour is no doubt of it reſerued to an ende, yet that exigent ſo ſequeſters them from any libertie of likyng, that he who but carries the name for his after commoditie, muſt bee glad of the repulſe for his vniuſt title.</p>
               <p>So that now <hi>Fauellus,</hi> I muſt conclude in beauties cauſe, as vniuſt tyrauntes in their owne ouerweanyng, <hi>Stat pro ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione voluntas,</hi> Beauties alowance ſtandes for reaſon: And if I haue not concluded well faire Ladies be you Iudge.</p>
               <p>But Madem <hi>Frunces,</hi> as you inuented the order, ſo now muſt I alter my ſentence, and as your concluſions were moſt ſerious. ſo will I more ſeuerely conclude of your cenſure.</p>
               <p>You as naturally inclined to maintain a Commonwealth (in that you are a neceſſary membre to multiplie) giue phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence to the law maker, and not without reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt he contenueth and increaſeth peace, preſcribeth and
<pb facs="tcp:16402:73"/> performeth good lawes, ye ſo ordereth all thinges, that no thinges can be lawleſſe that is within his reche, nor any thing vnlookt to where he maie haue libertie. But Docter <hi>Furneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who can deſcant on all natures, in colouryng the errours of the Lawyer, ciphereth out his owne perfections, he will not tell how the Lawyer is a peny Father, how a maintainer of contencions, how like to <hi>Aeſopes</hi> Rite, who while the mouſe and the Froge ſtroue togither for ſuprimecie in the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rſhe, he denoured them both, and made the ſoure of their contention the ſwet of his praie,</p>
               <p>But he wiſely reputes him praiſe, by that meanes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie the excellency of his practiſe, for (ſaieth he) if the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer bee commodious then he that contenueth this commodity muſt of force be accounted more profitable.</p>
               <p>But if Doctor <hi>Furnelius,</hi> ſhould remember, that by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of his potions, the euil are enabled to more vnlawful practiſes, and the Lawier being by him recouered, is lefte to folow his wonted exerciſe, to maintaine ſtrife and contention in a ſtate, for the verie brables and quarrelſome debates that are had amongſt fooles, is the onelie credite, reputation, and maintenance of the Lawyer: And therfore (Madame <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> not to diſſemble with you, who hath ſaid ſo well for them, and not to flatter Maiſter Doctor, who hath aleadged ſo much in his owne behalfe, I muſt conclude the Phiſition to bee the moſt profitable member in a common wealth, for that he many times with his medicines killeth the Lawier, who, while hee liued in health, couſins the poore comminaltie of their coine, with his crafte.</p>
               <p>So now my faire Ladies, and good Gentlemen the debate may ceaſe: and if it ſhall pleaſe you to ſleepe vpon my verdite, if to morrow you ſhall not like it, you may reuerſe it with a writ of errour, ſo you put in good ſureties: And we will not trouble the Iudge wyth common baile (ſaide Madam <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>) in ſo ſerious a cauſe: yea but Madame (ſaid <hi>Simonides</hi>) I muſt put you to your booke othe before I admitte you: As for that concluſion (ſaid Ladie <hi>Fraunccs</hi>) ſince it lieth on your curteſie to eſteeme, I doubt not but you will forbeare if you

               </p>
               <p>With theſe merie greetings, the aſſemblie beyng broken vp, eche betooke themſelues to their lodging, leauing <hi>Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> to the curteſie of <hi>Philautus</hi> and his violet, who conducted him to his chamber, and lefte him to his nightes reſt after his long trauaile.</p>
               <p>He thus in a ſtrange ſoile, and amongſt ſtrange people, was troubled with as ſtrange imaginations, firſt with the felicitie of the Ilande, next of the opulencie of the inhabitants, then of the bountie of their repaſt, thinking in himſelfe, that <hi>Euphues</hi> praiſe might wel perſwade ſo farre, and that <hi>England</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fortunate, beyng ſo fruitful in all bleſſings.</p>
               <p>And ſleepyng on theſe imaginations, on the morrowe at conuenient time, he was conducted by <hi>Philautus</hi> vnto the Engliſh court, where he not onelie receiued a freendly <hi>Bein <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enu</hi> of <hi>Surius,</hi> but alſo a curteous ſalutation of Madam <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here it were a wonder to write, how his imaginations wrought, comparyng <hi>Euphues</hi> reports, with his own proofes, there ſawe he as great brauerie as might be, as much beauty as was requiſite, ech ſubiect ſo ſumptuous, that rauiſhed with the imagination of the inferiour, he beganne euen then to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate what might be in the ſuperior, but when the Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth</hi> preſented hir ſelfe, in whom findyng auſtere ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe befittyng a Princeſſe, curteous affabilitie to entertaine freends, incomparable beautie to allure an enimie: admirable chaſtitie againſt all aſſaultes of fancies, conſtant reſolutions in wortthy attemptes, ineſtimable dowers of learnyng with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie blemiſh of arrogancie: he concluded as the Paynter did of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> proportion, that ſince theſe verie <hi>Principia</hi> of hir vertues were vnſpeakeable, it were not poſſible to cyphre out the true ſimilitudes of hir perfections, nor reſemble that by ſhadowes, which relied vpon a more than heauenly conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>Thus fared it with <hi>Simonides</hi> at that inſtant, as that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither confounded in his imaginations, he here ſet vp his reſt confirming, that if <hi>England</hi> were as happie for ſubiectes as it
<pb facs="tcp:16402:74"/> was bleſſed in a Prince, that it might be reported of, as it was of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Cato,</hi> that the gouernement was happy by reaſons of vertues, but eſpecially bleſſed in ſo gratious a gouerneſſe.</p>
               <p>Herevpon he poſted ouer his wanderpng eies to more ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, yet ſeemely obiectes, and takyng the viewe of the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladies in Courte, in whome beholdyng ſuch ſtrange and ſundrie faſhions, ſuch imitating of all exceſſe, that was vſed through <hi>Europe,</hi> he concluded in his imagination, that either the Ladies bare theſe patternes in ſcorne of the abuſe, or loath to yeelde to anie countrie in curioſitie, vouchſafed the faſhion though they admitted not the vice.</p>
               <p>When he looked into the whole ſtate of Gentlemen, and finding ſome of the yonger ſorte to be more than halfe effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, light in attire, imitating ſuch newfangles, as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeamly for men. He varied in his opinion thus much, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Euphues</hi> ſought to confirme him by contraries, or <hi>Engliſh</hi> brauery was <hi>Napolitan</hi> exceſſe, and that both <hi>Napolitan</hi> and <hi>Engliſhe</hi> ryot was to be lamented, not commended.</p>
               <p>This befell on <hi>Simonides</hi> in the oueruewe of the <hi>Engliſhe</hi> Court, and thus fared it in his fantaſies, ſo that in him ſelf he began to conclude an opinion, when at the very inſtant noble <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> with <hi>Madamoſilla Camilla,</hi> with <hi>Philautus</hi> in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all at one inſtante came vnto him, conductyng him vnto their mantion houſe, where <hi>Simonides</hi> beheld ſuch new brauery as wrought in his minde a new wonder.: The muſicke was ſo delicate, the meate ſo daintie, the entertainment ſo hartie, the ſeruiſe ſo ſtatly, the ſeruitours ſo ſeamly, to conclude euery thing was ſo ſumptious, as the glory of the Spaniſh Court ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med propoſterous in compariſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camilla</hi> willing to delight the ſtraunger with as great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie as ſhe could, leauing the reſt of the companie, betooke her ſelf to entertaine him, began in theſe tearmes to commence her diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Curtious Gentleman, it ſeemeth me that either you are fed with diſdain, or led with ſome miſlike, your behauiour is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike, and your demeanour ſo miſcontent: if ought be here

               <p>Madam ſaied <hi>Simonides,</hi> if wonder bread malencholie, I confeſſe my ſelf ſubiect to the humour, the pleaſures here bee ſo infinit, as one drowneth an other, &amp; al haue relation to one beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on whiche thei attend, whiche amongſt all the delightes that wait on your Court, on myne Honour moſt contenteth mee.</p>
               <p>And if beautie pleaſe your affectes ſo much (ſaied <hi>Camilla</hi>) truely this houſe is vnfortunate onely in that pleaſure, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng, ſuch louely browne as our Courtiours are acoſtomd to, you maie be aquainted with: and your Ladieſhip maie doe me great fauour in this (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) wherevpon the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die callyng out three of the moſt beautiefull Damoſeles of her traine, began to diſcourſe againe thus with <hi>Simonides.</hi>

               <p>Since (noble Spaniard) it is beautie that delighteth you, I haue brought you three patturns to imploye your cunnyng on, whiche ſhall atend both on your cup and trencher, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie ſuch ſimple diſcourſe as their yong heades will afford them</p>

               <p>And will you binde me (Miſtris) to that extreamitie (ſaied <hi>Simonides</hi>) truely then the caſe will goe harde, for if it muſt be concluded, that I muſt loue there where I commend, I ſhould loue the white <hi>Mercurie</hi> though deadly poyſon, I ſhould feede on the glorious Diamonde though rancke <hi>Aconitum,</hi> yea, I ſhould by the deemyng of myne eye, bee domed to myne owne deſtruction: but becauſe it is wiſedome to auoyde ſuche an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, faire Ladies I muſt conclude this, that I loue you all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng beautifull, I honour you beyng vertuous, and reuerence you beyng wiſe.</p>

                  <hi>Simonides,</hi> vpon the ſodaine thus tropmed vpon, was almoſt paſt all helpe how to recouer hymſelf: notwithſtandyng, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng vnto the plauſabilitie of his wit, he concluded all their circumuentions by this pretie delaie.

               <p>I ſee now that the ſtate of the worlde is ſtraunge, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men vncertaine, the pleaſures of this life but ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and no happineſſe to a contented mynde.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Simonides</hi> ignoraunt of the ſequell, ariued at <hi>Ciuill,</hi> the rumor of whoſe returne, was brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares of his father, but Lorde how pleaſaunt were theſe newes to the olde man, how iocond was the mother, the whole Citie gaue him a frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome: But as euery ſweete is quickly ouerlaied with a little ſowre, and the Sunne darkened with a blacke Cloude, ſo theſe delightes were as ſone croſſed, by the vniuſt diſaſter of <hi>Clarinda</hi> the vncourteous.

               <p>Is this the fruites of Loue, O you Heauens, are theſe the rewardes of loyall ſeruice, are womens fantaſies ſo fickle, and Ladies trothes ſo vncertaine. Oh wicked ſexe, that vnder faire white, ſhrowdeſt blacke venome, that vnder ſeemely ſubſtaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, concludeſt vnſtable perfections. Curſed <hi>Clarinda,</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thou thy iniuſtice is not ſuche, as the very blemiſhe ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all womenhood? Was age more ſeemely for thy bed then youth? Was loathſomneſſe in better likyng then tried loue? Diddeſt thou vowe to be chaſt, and haſt proued diſſolute. Canſt thou promiſe faire, and performe ſo ill. Wouldeſt thou ſhewe to be a Sainct, and proue a Deuill. Wouldeſt thou looke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely, and like diſhoneſtly. Couldeſt thou ſimper it with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie, and bee bereft of all humanitie. Woe is me that gaue truſt to inconſtancie, learnt Loue on vnworthie, ſhewed fauour to falſhood, and continued conſtaunt to a carrion.</p>
               <p>Farre was thy nature <hi>(Clarinda)</hi> from Nobilitie, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt no better choyce, but it was in deſpight of <hi>Simonides,</hi> who in deſpite of thee will conclude thus,
